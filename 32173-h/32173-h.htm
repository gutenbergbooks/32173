<p class='c fs18 mb20'>UNDER BOY SCOUT COLORS</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LIVE WIRE</span></h2>

<p>Dale Tompkins slung the bulging bag of
papers over one shoulder, and, turning
away from the news-stand, walked briskly down
the main street of Hillsgrove. The rain had
ceased, and the wind that had howled fiercely all
day long was shifting into the west, where it tore
to tatters the banks of dun gray clouds, letting
through gleams and patches of cold blue sky tinged
with the pale, chill yellow of a typical autumn
sunset.</p>

<p>The cold look of that sunset was well borne out
by a keen nip in the air, but Dale was too thankful
to have it clear at all to complain. Besides, he
wasn&#8217;t exactly the complaining sort. Turning
up the collar of a rather shabby coat, he thrust
both hands deep into his trousers&#8217; pockets and
hurried whistling along, bent on delivering his
papers in the quickest possible time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>&#8220;I ought to get home by seven, anyhow,&#8221; he
thought calculatingly. &#8220;And if Mother&#8217;ll only
give me a hurry-up snack, I&#8217;ll be in time for meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rolled the last word under his tongue with
the prideful accent of a novice. Then, with a sudden
start, one hand jerked out of his pocket and
slipped between the buttons of the thread-bare
coat. For an anxious moment it groped there before
the fingers closed over a metal badge, shaped
like a trefoil, that was pinned securely to the
flannel shirt. A somewhat sheepish grin overspread
the freckled face, and through an open gate
Dale shot a paper dexterously across the porch to
land accurately in the middle of the door-mat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to lose it the very first week,&#8221; he
muttered, with a touch of apology. Mechanically
he delivered another paper, and then he sighed.
&#8220;Gee! A month sure seems an awful long time
to wait when you know about all the tests already.
I could even pass some of the first-class ones, I
bet! That handbook&#8217;s a dandy, all right. I
don&#8217;t guess there was ever another book printed
with so much in it, exceptin&#8217;, maybe&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The words froze on his lips, and he caught his
breath with a sharp, hissing intake. From somewhere
in the next block a scream rang out on the
still air, so shrill, so sudden, so full of surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
and pain and utter terror that Dale&#8217;s blood turned
cold within him, and the arm, half extended to toss
a folded paper, halted in the middle of its swing, as
if encountering an invisible obstacle. The pause
was only momentary. Abruptly, as if two hands
were pressed around a throbbing throat, the cry
was cut off, and in the deathly silence that followed,
Dale hurled the paper hastily, but accurately,
from him, and turned and ran.</p>

<p>Eyes wide and face a little white, he tore across
the road, splashing through puddles and slipping
in the soft mud. Whirling around the corner into
Pine Street, he saw a woman rush bareheaded out
of a near-by house and two men come running
down an adjacent alley. Rather, he noted them
with that odd sense of observation which works
intuitively, for his whole being was concentrated
on the sight of that slight, boyish figure lying motionless
in the roadway.</p>

<p>For a second Dale stared blankly, unable to understand.
His first thought was that some human
agency had done this thing, but almost as swiftly
he realized that there was no one in sight who
could have struck the child unconscious, nor had
there been time for such an assailant to get away.
Then, as he hurried closer through the gathering
dusk, he caught sight of a trailing wire gripped
convulsively in the small hands, and in a flash he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
realized the truth. In a flash, too, he realized that
the body was not as motionless as he had supposed.
A writhing, twisting movement, slight but ceaseless,
quivered through the helpless victim, from
his thin, black-stockinged legs to the blue lips. To
the white-faced lad bending over him it seemed to
tell of great suffering borne, perforce, in silence&#8211;and
he was such a little kid!</p>

<p>From Dale&#8217;s own lips there burst a smothered,
inarticulate cry. Every idea, save the vital need
of tearing loose that killing grip, vanished from
the older boy&#8217;s mind. Heedless of a warning
shout from one of the men, he bent swiftly forward
and caught the child by one shoulder.</p>

<p>What happened then Dale was never afterward
able to describe clearly. It was as if some monstrous
tingling force, greater, stranger than anything
he had ever known, struck at him out of
the air. In a twinkling it tore him from the boy
on the ground and hurled him almost the width
of the street. He crashed against the stone curbing
and for a second or two lay there, dazed and
blinking, then climbed painfully to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to have&#8211;touched him&#8211;with my
bare hands,&#8221; he muttered uncertainly. &#8220;I must
have got nearly the whole charge!&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt faint and sick and wobbly. From the
horrified group gathered helplessly around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
unconscious boy across the street, a woman&#8217;s hysterical
cry beat on his brain with monotonous iteration:
&#8220;What can we do? What can we do?
It&#8217;s terrible! Oh, can&#8217;t you do something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had rubber gloves&#8211;&#8221; murmured
one of the men, vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s a &#8217;phone?&#8221; interrupted another.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get &#8217;em to shut off the current!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; some one replied. People were
constantly rushing up to gasp and exclaim, but do
nothing. &#8220;The power-house is clear over at Medina.
It&#8217;ll take too long to get the connection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try, anyhow,&#8221; was the sharp retort.
&#8220;It&#8217;s better than doing nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he dashed past Dale and disappeared into a
neighboring house, the boy moved slowly forward.
He splashed through a puddle, and something
he had read, or heard, came back to him.
Water was a perfect conductor, and he had been
standing in a regular pool of it when he grabbed
the child. No wonder he had been shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Insulation,&#8221; he murmured, his head still swimming.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! The handbook says&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The bag of papers bumped against his thigh,
and somehow Dale&#8217;s numbed brain began to clear
swiftly. How could he have forgotten that paper
was a non-conductor as well as silk or rubber?
Rubber! Why, the bag itself was made of some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
kind of waterproof stuff. He thrust aside a half-grown,
gaping youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a show, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; he cried almost
fiercely. Thrilled, exhilarated with a sudden
sense of power, he jerked the bag off his shoulder.
&#8220;The kid&#8217;ll never live if he waits for you
fellows to do something.&#8221; With extraordinary
swiftness he pulled out several thicknesses of
newspaper and wrapped them about one hand and
arm. Similarly swathing the other, he dropped
the rubber-coated bag to the ground and stepped
squarely on it. His eyes were wide and almost
black with excitement. &#8220;Oh, cut that out!&#8221; he
snapped over one shoulder to a protesting bystander.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose I <i>know</i> what I&#8217;m doing?
I&#8217;m a scout!&#8221;</p>

<p>A second later he had gripped the unconscious
child again by an arm and shoulder. This time
there was no shock, only a queer, vibratory tingling
that Dale scarcely noticed, so intent was he
on doing the right thing. He must not bungle
now. He remembered perfectly what the book
said about releasing a person in contact with a
live wire. It must be done quickly and cleanly,
without unnecessary tugging, or else the shock
and burning would be greatly increased. Dale
braced his feet and drew a long breath. Then,
suddenly, he jerked backward with all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
strength he could summon. The next thing he
knew he was sitting squarely in a puddle with both
arms around the child, whose grip on the deadly
wire he had broken.</p>

<p>Instantly the hitherto inactive group was roused
to life and movement, and amidst a Babel of talk
and advice they surged around the unconscious lad
and his rescuer. Before the latter realized what
had happened, some one had snatched the little
chap from him and started swiftly toward one of
the near-by houses. After and around them
streamed a throng of men, women, and children,
pitying, anxious, or merely curious, but, now that
the danger was past, all equally voluble with suggestions
or advice.</p>

<p>Dale rose slowly to his feet, and stood for a
moment staring after them with a troubled frown.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they give him air?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
only they wouldn&#8217;t bunch around him like
that&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused hesitatingly, watching the procession
mount the steps and cross a wide veranda. The
stress and excitement that had dominated him till
now seemed to have vanished, and a reaction set
in. He wondered whether folks wouldn&#8217;t think
him too &#8220;fresh&#8221; for thrusting himself forward as
he had done. The remembrance of the man to
whom he had talked back made him wriggle uncomfortably;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
it was one of his oldest customers.
&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he muttered, with a touch of uneasiness;
&#8220;I reckon I must have sassed him pretty well,
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dusk had given place to night. Under a flaring
gas-light at the curb two early arrivals, who had
stayed behind to guard the deadly, dangling wire,
were busy explaining the situation to several wide-eyed
later comers. They formed an animated
group, and Dale, standing in the shadow behind
them, felt curiously out of it and alone. The wind,
sweeping up the street, struck through his wet
clothes and made him shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time I was getting started,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It
must be awful late.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he bent over to pick up his bag, the movement
set his head to throbbing afresh. His exploring
fingers encountered a lump, where he had
hit the curb, that felt about the size of an ostrich-egg.
Dale&#8217;s forehead wrinkled, and he opened the
bag mechanically, only to find the remaining
papers were soaked through and ruined. Those
he had wrapped around his hands lay in the mud at
his feet, soggy masses of pulp. And he had delivered
only four out of the lot!</p>

<p>Dale tried to smile, but his lips only quivered.
With a second, more determined, effort, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
clenched his teeth tightly, slung the empty bag
over his shoulder, and started back toward the
news-stand. But he went in silence. Somehow
the usual whistle was impossible.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE NEW TENDERFOOT</span></h2>

<p>It was close to half past seven before Dale delivered
his last paper. He had been delayed
in the beginning by old Jed Hathaway&#8217;s having to
know all about it, and insisting on hearing every
little detail before he could be induced to provide
a second supply. Dale tried to be patient under
the cross-examination of the garrulous old newsdealer,
but it wasn&#8217;t easy when he knew that each
minute wasted now was going to make it harder to
get through in time for the scout meeting. When
he was released at last, he hurried all he could, but
the minute-hand of the old town-clock was perilously
close to the perpendicular when he got back
to the square again.</p>

<p>Clearly, there was no time to go home even
for that &#8220;hurry up&#8221; snack he had been thinking
about. There wasn&#8217;t even time to get a sandwich
from the lunch-wagon, two blocks away. &#8220;Have
to pull in my belt and forget about it till I get home
after meeting, I reckon,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>In suiting the action to the word he realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
that his hurried efforts at the news-stand to clean
off the mud had been far from successful. It
plastered his person, if not from head to foot, at
least from the waist down, and now that it was
beginning to dry, it seemed to show up more distinctly
each moment. He couldn&#8217;t present himself
before Scoutmaster Curtis in such a plight, so
he raced across the square to his friend Joe
Banta&#8217;s shoe-cleaning establishment, borrowed a
stiff brush, and went to work vigorously.</p>

<p>Brief as was the delay, it sufficed to make him
late. Though not at all sectarian, Troop Five
held its weekly meetings in the parish-house of the
Episcopal church, whose rector was intensely interested
in the movement. These were scheduled
for seven-thirty on Monday evenings. There was
usually a brief delay for belated scouts, but by
twenty minutes of eight, at latest, the shrill blast
of the scoutmaster&#8217;s whistle brought the fellows
at attention, ready for the salute to the flag and
the other simple exercises that opened the meeting.</p>

<p>Precisely one minute later Dale Tompkins burst
hastily into the vestibule and pulled up abruptly.
Through the open door a long line of khaki-clad
backs confronted him, trim, erect, efficient-looking.
Each figure stood rigidly at attention, shoulders
back, eyes set straight ahead, three fingers pressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
against the forehead in the scout salute, and lips
moving in unison over the last words of the scout
oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;... To keep myself physically strong, mentally
awake, and morally straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colors post!&#8221; came crisply from the scoutmaster
facing the line.</p>

<p>From the shadows of the entry Dale felt a sort
of thrill at the precision of the movement and
the neatness with which the slim color-bearer, who
had faced the line just in front of Mr. Curtis and
his assistant, pivoted on his heel and bore the flag,
its silken folds gently rippling, past the scouts still
standing at attention and on out of sight toward
the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>Of course it was only Courtlandt Parker, who
was in Dale&#8217;s grade at school and a very familiar
person indeed. But somehow, in this rôle, he did
not seem nearly so familiar and intimate. To the
watching tenderfoot it was almost as if he had
ceased for the moment to be the airy, volatile,
harum-scarum &#8220;Court,&#8221; whose pranks and witticisms
so often kept the whole grade stirred up and
amused, and had become solely the sober, earnest,
serious color-bearer of the troop.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lot of it&#8217;s the uniform, of course,&#8221; thought
Dale. &#8220;It does make a whopping difference in a
fellow&#8217;s looks.&#8221; He glanced down at his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
worn, still disheveled garments with sudden distaste.
&#8220;I wish I had mine!&#8221; he sighed.</p>

<p>A moment later, still hesitating in the background,
reluctant to face that trim, immaculate
line, he caught the scoutmaster&#8217;s glance,&#8211;that
level, friendly, smiling glance, which was at once
a salutation and a welcome,&#8211;and his head went
up abruptly. What did looks matter, after all&#8211;at
least the sort of looks one couldn&#8217;t help? He
was none the worse a scout because he had not yet
saved up enough money for that coveted suit
of khaki. Nor was it his fault that he had lacked
the time to go home and brush up thoroughly
for the meeting. He smiled back a little at Mr.
Curtis, and then, with shoulders square and
head erect, he obeyed the leader&#8217;s silent summons.</p>

<p>There was a faint stir and a sense of curious,
shifting eyes when he appeared around the end
of the line of waiting scouts. As he passed Sherman
Ward&#8217;s patrol some one even whispered an
airy greeting, &#8220;Aye, Tommy.&#8221; Though Dale did
not glance that way, he knew it to be the irrepressible
Courtlandt, now returned to his position
as assistant patrol-leader. Court was the only
one who ever called him that, and the boy&#8217;s heart
warmed at this touch of friendliness. Then he
paused before the scoutmaster and promptly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
though perhaps a little awkwardly, returned the
man&#8217;s salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Dale,&#8221; the scoutmaster
said, in a tone which robbed the words of any
trace of the perfunctory. &#8220;I&#8217;d begun to think
something was keeping you away to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy flushed a little. &#8220;I&#8211;I was delayed,
sir,&#8221; he explained briefly. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;it won&#8217;t happen
again, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; The scoutmaster nodded approval,
his glance sweeping meditatively over the three
patrols. He was slim and dark, with eyes set
wide apart, and a humorous, rather sensitive
mouth. The boys liked him without exactly knowing
why, for he was not the popular athletic type
of scoutmaster, nor yet the sort of man who dominates
by sheer force of personality and commands
immense respect if nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of you fellows know Dale Tompkins, our
new tenderfoot,&#8221; he went on presently, raising his
voice a little. &#8220;For the benefit of those who don&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll say that he passed an extra good examination
last week, and I&#8217;ve an idea he&#8217;s going to be a
credit to the troop. He will take Arnold&#8217;s place
in Wolf patrol, which brings us up to our full
strength again. That&#8217;s the one at the head of the
line, Tompkins. Patrol-leader Ranleigh Phelps
will take you in charge and show you the ropes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>Dale&#8217;s heart leaped, and a sudden warm glow
came over him. He had never exchanged a word
with Ranny Phelps, and yet the handsome, dashing
leader of Wolf patrol probably had more to do
with Tompkins&#8217; becoming a member of Troop Five
than any other cause. The boy liked Mr. Curtis,
to be sure, and was glad to have him for a scoutmaster,
but his feeling for Phelps, though he had
never expressed it even to himself, was something
deeper than mere liking. To him, the good-looking,
blond chap seemed everything that a scout
should be and so seldom was. Perhaps one of the
reasons was because he always contrived to look
the part so satisfyingly. Whenever the troop appeared
in public, Phelps&#8217;s uniform fitted to perfection,
his bearing was invariably beyond criticism,
his execution of the various man&oelig;uvers was
crisp, snappy, faultless. In athletic events, too, he
was always prominent, entering in almost every
event, and coming out ahead in many. And he
was physically so picturesque with his clean-cut
features, gray eyes, and mass of curly blond hair,
his poise and perfect self-possession, that gradually
in the breast of the rugged, unornamental
Tompkins there had grown up a shy admiration,
a silent, wistful liking which strengthened as time
went on almost to hero-worship, yet which, of
course, he would have perished sooner than reveal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
When he had at length gained his father&#8217;s
grudging permission to become a scout, it was this
feeling mainly which prompted him to make application
to Troop Five. He had not dared to
hope that Mr. Curtis would actually assign him to
Ranny Phelps&#8217;s patrol.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8211;I&#8217;m to stay in&#8211;in Wolf patrol,
sir?&#8221; he stammered incredulously.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only vacancy.
Both the others are filled. Ranny will
show you where your place is, and then we&#8217;ll
proceed with the drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>With face a little flushed, the tenderfoot turned
and took a few steps toward the head of the line.
Just what he expected from his hero he could not
have said. Perhaps he vaguely felt that Phelps
would step forward and shake his hand, or at
least greet the new-comer with a welcoming
smile. But Ranny did not stir from his place.
Stiff and straight he stood there, and as Tompkins
paused hesitatingly, the shapely lips curled
unpleasantly at the corners, and the gray eyes
ranged slowly over him from head to heel and
back again in a manner that sent the blood
surging into the boy&#8217;s face and brought his lids
down abruptly to hide the swift surprise and
hurt that flashed into his brown eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of the line, tenderfoot,&#8221; ordered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Phelps, curtly. &#8220;And don&#8217;t be all day about
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter words were in an undertone which
could not well have reached beyond the ears of
the lad for whom they were intended. The chill
unfriendliness of the whole remark affected Dale
Tompkins much like a douche of ice-cold water.
With head suddenly erect and lips compressed,
he swiftly took his place at the end of the patrol,
next to a plump, red-cheeked boy named Vedder,
who, save for a brief, swiftly averted side-glance,
gave no further evidence of welcome than had
the leader.</p>

<p>In the brief pause that followed while the
assistant patrol-leaders procured staves and distributed
them, the tenderfoot tried to solve the
problem. What was the matter? he asked himself
in troubled bewilderment. What had he
done that was wrong? Naturally a cheerful,
friendly soul, he could not imagine himself, were
their positions reversed, treating a stranger with
such chill formality. But perhaps he had expected
too much. After all, there was no reason
why the fellows should break ranks in the middle
of meeting and fall on his neck, when not more
than a third of the crowd had ever spoken to
him before. For a moment he had forgotten that
while he had long ardently admired Ranny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
Phelps from afar, the blond chap had probably
never even heard his name before. It would be
different when they came to know each other.</p>

<p>Cheered by this thought, Dale braced up and
flung himself with characteristic ardor into acquiring
the various movements of the drill.
These were not difficult, but somehow, try as he
might, he could not seem to satisfy his leader.
At every slightest error, or even hesitation,
Ranny flew out at him with a caustic sharpness
that swiftly got the tenderfoot&#8217;s nerve and made
him blunder more than ever. Yet still he found
excuses for the fellow he so admired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t blame anybody for not liking to
coach up a greenhorn when all the rest of them do
it so well,&#8221; he said to himself after the meeting
was over and the boys were leaving the hall.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the best patrol of the three, all right, and
I&#8217;ll just have to get busy and learn the drill, so&#8217;s
not to make a single mistake.&#8221; He sighed a little.
&#8220;I wish&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Dale? Seems to me
you&#8217;re looking mighty serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hand dropped on his shoulder, and Dale
glanced swiftly up to meet the quizzical, inquiring
gaze of Mr. Curtis. He hesitated an instant, a
touch of embarrassment in his answering smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, sir,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
just thinking what a dub I am at that drill, and
wishing&#8211;a complete uniform costs six-thirty,
doesn&#8217;t it, Mr. Curtis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster nodded. &#8220;Would you like me
to order one for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale laughed a little wistfully. &#8220;I sure
would!&#8221; he ejaculated fervently. &#8220;The trouble
is I only have about four dollars and that isn&#8217;t
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; The man hesitated an instant,
his eyes on the boy&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what
we can do, though,&#8221; he went on slowly. &#8220;If you
like, I&#8217;ll advance the difference so that you can
have it right away, and you can pay me back
whenever it&#8217;s convenient.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Dale did not speak. Then he
shook his head regretfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s mighty good
of you, sir, but I guess I&#8217;d better&#8211;&#8221; He paused
abruptly, and a slow flush crept into his face.
&#8220;Does a fellow <i>have</i> to have one? Would I be&#8211;that
is, if I didn&#8217;t have one for a while, will it&#8211;make
a lot of difference for the other fellows&#8211;will
it look bad for the troop?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis laughed suddenly, and his hand
tightened a bit on the boy&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Bless you,
no!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Get rid of that notion right
away. I thoroughly believe in every scout&#8217;s
wanting a uniform, and working for it, and wearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
it whenever he can, and being proud of it, but
I&#8217;d hate awfully to have him feel that he was
out of place in Troop Five without one. It&#8217;s the
spirit that makes the scout, not clothes, and I&#8217;m
just a little glad you didn&#8217;t accept my offer, Dale.
Keep on saving for it, and, when you&#8217;ve enough,
come to me. Meanwhile&#8211;you say you didn&#8217;t get
the drill very well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I was rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re new to it, and to the
crowd, and everything. It really isn&#8217;t hard. If
you can come around to my house after supper
to-morrow night, I&#8217;ll coach you up in half an hour
so you can&#8217;t make a mistake next Friday if you
try. That&#8217;ll put you on even terms with the rest
of the troop, and make you forget this little matter
of clothes. How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s eyes brightened. &#8220;That would be corking,
sir! Of course I can come, only won&#8217;t it be
a trouble to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. Come any time after seven. You
know where I live, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I&#8217;ll be there, all right; and thank
you ever so much for helping me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t,&#8221; smiled the scoutmaster. &#8220;It
will be a pleasure.&#8221; He dropped his hand and was
turning away when his glance rested on the boy&#8217;s
solid-looking shoulders and then traveled on down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
over the lithe frame. &#8220;Play football?&#8221; he asked,
with a touch of fresh interest.</p>

<p>Dale nodded eagerly. &#8220;Yes, sir; as much as
I&#8217;ve had time for, that is. Do&#8211;do you think I&#8217;d
have any show for the team?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder. See Sherman Ward;
he&#8217;s captain. The season&#8217;s half over, but we
need weight behind the line, and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise
me if you&#8217;d do. Try it, anyhow. Good
night; see you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale found his cap and slipped out of the building,
a pleasant glow stealing over him. &#8220;He&#8217;s
corking!&#8221; he muttered, as he followed the flagged
walk that led past the shadowy bulk of the stone
church to the street. &#8220;He makes a fellow feel&#8211;well,
sort of as if he belonged!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been a chump to let himself be troubled
by Ranny Phelps&#8217;s brusqueness. &#8220;Of course he
was peeved when I made such a mess of things,&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;Just wait till next Friday, though,
and he&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s progress along the walk and his train
of thought stopped abruptly at one and the same
time. He had reached the side of the squat stone
tower that faced the street, but was still in the
shadow, when the voice of Ranny Phelps, somewhat
shrill with temper and unmistakably scornful
of accent, smote suddenly on his ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;The idea of a mucker like that being in Troop
Five&#8211;and in my own patrol, too! It&#8217;s simply
sickening! You saw him to-night; so stupid he
couldn&#8217;t even learn the drill, and did anybody ever
see such clothes? They look as if they&#8217;d come
out of the rag-bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>An indistinguishable murmur in another voice
seemed merely to goad the irate patrol-leader to
increased frenzy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it&#8211;a common newsboy! He&#8217;ll be
an ornament to the troop, won&#8217;t he? He&#8217;ll make
a fine-looking scout, he will! I can just see what
a rotten mess he&#8217;ll make of the line if we should
have to march in public. Mr. Curtis must be crazy
to take in such riffraff, and I&#8217;ve half a mind to
tell him&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of the remark was indistinguishable,
for the speakers were moving away from the
church in the direction of the better class, residential
section. Presently, even the rising and
falling murmur of voices ceased, but still the figure
in the shadow of the church tower did not stir.
When at last he moved slowly forward into the
circle of an electric light, something of the hard
grayness of the stone might almost have come into
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A scout is a friend to all and a brother to
every other scout,&#8217;&#8221; he said, half aloud, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
turned in an opposite direction to that taken by
Phelps and his companion.</p>

<p>Then he laughed. It wasn&#8217;t exactly a pleasant
sound. There was no mirth in it; only scorn, derision,
and, under all the rest, a note of pain that
could not quite be hidden.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SILVER LINING</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Say, fellows, did you hear about Jimmy Warren&#8217;s
kid brother?&#8221; eagerly inquired Court
Parker, skipping up to a group gathered about the
school steps next morning.</p>

<p>From force of habit, expectant grins wreathed
several faces. &#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Bob Gibson, suspiciously.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joke!&#8221; repeated the latest comer, indignantly.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any joke. What gave you that idea?
It came pretty near being serious, I can tell you.
One of the electric feed-wires got loose in the
storm yesterday, and hung down in front of Jimmy&#8217;s
house on Pine Street. Before anybody else
saw it, that crazy kid Georgie had to go out and
grab hold of it with both hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused an instant for breath, and a concerted
exclamation went up from the crowd that
had gathered swiftly about him. &#8220;Gee!&#8221; exclaimed
stout Harry Vedder. &#8220;And the current
still on, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;Of course it was! Dad told me how many
volts. I forget. Anyhow, Georgie got hold and
couldn&#8217;t let go. They said he yelled to beat the
band, and then went clean out. A crowd got
around right away, but nobody seemed to know
what to do. One man ran in and started &#8217;phoning
for &#8217;em to turn off the current; and while he was
gone, what do you think happened? A kid with a
bunch of papers came along, and jumped right in
and grabbed hold of Georgie to pull him off the
wire. They said that when the current hit him
it was like being kicked by a horse. He went
clean across the street and banged his head an
awful whack on the curb. He got up sort of
groggy, but he must have been a game one, for
he came right back, wrapped some newspapers
around his hands, and had Georgie loose in a
jiffy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; came in an appreciative chorus.
Then one of the third-grade boys piped up curiously.
&#8220;But what good was the newspaper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insulation, of course,&#8221; spoke up Sherman
Ward, from the outskirts of the group. He was
tall enough to look over the heads of most of the
fellows, and spoke with a certain authority. &#8220;If
he hadn&#8217;t used them he&#8217;d have got the shock as
he did the first time. That&#8217;s some idea, though,
fellows. I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d have remembered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
right off the bat, that paper was a non-conductor.
Who was he, Court?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows; that&#8217;s the funny part of it.&#8221;
Court thrust back a dangling lock of brown hair
with a characteristic gesture. &#8220;It was pretty
near dark, and everybody was excited, and all
that, Mrs. Warren told Dad when he was over
this morning. She said she only noticed that he
wasn&#8217;t so very tall and carried his papers in a
bag over one shoulder. She forgot all about him
till after they&#8217;d got the kid into the house and
the doctor had come. Then when she sent somebody
out to see, the chap had gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the throng of boys was plunged into
a fever of interested speculation. The idea of an
unknown appearing suddenly out of the darkness,
doing his spectacular stunt, and slipping away
again without revealing himself appealed tremendously
to the imagination. The fact that he
was a boy and quite possibly one of themselves
vastly increased the interest. One after another
the various fellows with paper routes were suggested,
but for the most part as quickly dismissed.
One was too tall, another delivered in a different
part of town, two more were part of the present
assemblage and reluctantly denied any connection
with the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it was that fellow Tompkins,&#8221; doubtfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
suggested Bob Gibson, when most of the
other possibilities had been exhausted. &#8220;He goes
past Pine Street, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden low laugh touched with scorn, from
the outskirts of the circle, turned all eyes to
where Ranny Phelps leaned against the iron
railing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite a joker, aren&#8217;t you, Bob?&#8221; commented
the blond chap, with a flash of his white
teeth.</p>

<p>Gibson sniffed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything so awful
funny in that,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;He does go past
Pine Street about every night; I&#8217;ve seen him
often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite possibly,&#8221; agreed Phelps, suavely. &#8220;I
never said he didn&#8217;t, you old grumbler. He probably
went past last night, but take my word for
it he didn&#8217;t turn in. You don&#8217;t suppose that
thickhead would have the gumption to do what
this chap did, or the wit to know about paper
being a non-conductor, and all that? Not in a
thousand years!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s mouth set stubbornly; he was one who
never lost a chance to argue. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see it at
all!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Just because you say so
doesn&#8217;t make him thick. I noticed you picking on
him last night, and I tell you right now that anybody
might seem&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t <i>seem</i> brainless&#8211;he <i>was</i>,&#8221; interrupted
Phelps with cool, scornful certainty. &#8220;A
fellow who could manage to fall over his feet as
many times as he did in that simple little drill,
and make as many breaks&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly and bit his lips. At the
farther edge of the wide circle the face of Tompkins
himself had loomed all at once into his surprised
consciousness, and something in the boy&#8217;s
level, unsmiling, somber glance brought a twinge
of shame to Ranleigh&#8217;s heart. For an instant
he stood silent, striving to resume his usual cool
nonchalance. Then he turned away with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;But after all,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;it&#8217;s hardly worth
while arguing about. Who&#8217;s got that seventh
problem in Geom? It&#8217;s a sticker, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was well enough done to deceive most of the
fellows about him, particularly since the sound
of the last bell started the crowd up the steps
and into the school building. But Court Parker
had noted the direction of Ranny&#8217;s glance, and a
gleam of indignation flashed into his eyes. For a
moment he stood biting his lips; then his face
cleared and he pounced on Tompkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, were you, Tommy!&#8221; he demanded airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was I what?&#8221; countered the other, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hero&#8211;the chap who leaped into the
breach and saved Georgie Warren from a&#8211;a&#8211;an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
electrocutive finish.&#8221; Court&#8217;s metaphors might
be mixed, but his vocabulary seldom lacked originality.
Tompkins merely shrugged his shoulders
and frowned a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it likely?&#8221; he asked, with a touch of bitterness.
&#8220;Even if I&#8217;d had the chance, I&#8217;m too thick
to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; cut in Court, swiftly. As they went
up the steps he flung an arm impulsively around
the other&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about
anything Ranny Phelps says. Nobody ever pays
any attention to him, anyhow. I do wish I knew
who that plucky chap was, though. It was a corking
thing to do. You haven&#8217;t heard any one say,
have you, Tommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tompkins hesitated an instant, an odd indecision
in his face. A few minutes ago he might
have found a boyish pride and pleasure in his
friend&#8217;s surprise at learning his part in the affair.
Now he merely shook his head. &#8220;Those
I&#8217;ve heard&#8211;talking about it, didn&#8217;t seem to
know,&#8221; he returned shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Well, I guess I&#8217;ll have to start my
mighty brain working and do the Sherlock Holmes
stunt,&#8221; decided Court, philosophically. &#8220;Say!
Won&#8217;t Jimmy be crazy, though, to be away at
school with all this happening to his own family.
I can just see him squirm!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>As they entered the coat-room his volatile mind
leaped to another topic. &#8220;There&#8217;s one good
thing, old top; you can come out for the troop
team now. That&#8217;ll be great! Don&#8217;t forget
there&#8217;s practice right after school this aft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale slapped his cap on a hook and turned
away. &#8220;I&#8217;m not coming out,&#8221; he said gruffly,
making for the door.</p>

<p>Court&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;Not coming out for
football!&#8221; he repeated amazedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, for goodness&#8217; sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; was the almost ungracious
retort.</p>

<p>Court sniffed incredulously. &#8220;Tell that to your
grandmother! Haven&#8217;t I seen you play often
enough to know better? Wait a second.&#8221; At the
entrance of the coat-room he caught Tompkins by
the arm, and, whirling him around, stared into his
face. &#8220;If you think for a minute,&#8221; he went on
with some heat, &#8220;that anybody&#8211; You old idiot!
You make me sick with your silly notions. I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll
settle you, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which cryptic and somewhat fragmentary
comment, he slapped Dale briskly on the back
and slipped into his seat, leaving the other to
seek his own place on the farther side of the
room, unconsciously heartened a bit by his fellow&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
friendliness. But a moment later his forehead
wrinkled perplexedly. Court had a little
habit of impulsively settling the affairs of nations
offhand, and his last remark seemed to indicate
that something of the kind was in his mind at
present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, whatever it is, he won&#8217;t get me to come
out for the team,&#8221; decided Tompkins, his jaw
squaring stubbornly. &#8220;They don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
good enough for them, and I&#8217;m not going to force
myself where I&#8217;m not wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those few words overheard just before had
opened afresh the wound of the night before and
confirmed Dale&#8217;s conviction that he was not
wanted in Troop Five. With the exception of
one or two of the boys who had been friendly
before, he felt that the scouts agreed with Ranny
Phelps in resenting his presence in the crack troop
of Hillsgrove. Because his father was a working-man,
because he himself sold papers to eke out
the family income, because, in short, he was poor
and had come to meeting in rather shabby clothes
instead of a natty uniform, they looked down on
him as an interloper who had no business to be
there. He would merely be inviting further
slights by appearing on the football field and trying
for a position on the troop eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can just see Sherman Ward&#8217;s expression if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
I did!&#8221; he thought bitterly. &#8220;He&#8217;s the niftiest
one of the lot, with his father owning the iron
works and about half the town besides. He
wouldn&#8217;t waste much time on me, I guess!&#8221;</p>

<p>Taken all in all, Dale failed to pass either a
pleasant or a profitable morning. He tried to
keep his mind on the lessons, but that wasn&#8217;t
easy. He had not yet decided whether or not to
remain in the troop, and this question seemed so
much more vital and important than arithmetic
problems or dates in ancient history that his
thoughts returned to it again and again. He
hated the idea of staying where he wasn&#8217;t wanted,
and yet to leave now would look as if he were a
coward, afraid to face the jibes and sarcasms of
the fellows who didn&#8217;t like him.</p>

<p>The end of the morning session found the problem
still unsolved. Dale was a little slow putting
his books away, and when he came to look for
Parker, who usually walked home with him, Court
was nowhere to be seen. As he left the building
he noticed a bunch of high-school boys from upstairs
laughing and fooling on the corner. Ranny
Phelps was among them, and several other members
of Troop Five, and unconsciously the tenderfoot
paused for an instant and half turned as if to
seek the other exit. A second later his lips tightened
and a dull flush came into his cheeks. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
never went home that way, why should he take it
now? Swiftly he turned back, and with head high
in a desperate effort to look unconscious, he
started briskly down the walk. He was within a
dozen feet of the jolly group when all at once there
came a hail from behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Dale!&#8221;</p>

<p>Astonished, he turned at the call to see Sherman
Ward coming down the school steps. For a moment
it seemed as if he must have been mistaken,
but the older chap quickly settled that doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, kid,&#8221; he went on; &#8220;I want to
talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant Dale&#8217;s interest in the throng at
the corner vanished. Surprised, curious, a little
on the defensive, he watched the approach of the
senior patrol-leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot to speak to you last night about football,&#8221;
Sherman began at once with brisk, casual
friendliness. &#8220;You play, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A&#8211;a little,&#8221; stammered Dale, dazed by the
absence of what he had so fully expected in the
other&#8217;s manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8211;tackle, and&#8211;and half-back&#8211;sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be a pretty good back if you&#8217;ve
got speed,&#8221; mused the older chap, his glance
appreciatively taking in the boy&#8217;s sturdy build
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
and good shoulders. &#8220;The season&#8217;s well along
and the team&#8217;s made up, but we need more weight.
Troop One&#8217;s the only team we&#8217;re afraid of, but
we&#8217;ve simply got to lick them and nab the pennant.
I&#8217;ll try you out this afternoon. Practice
at three-thirty sharp in the field back of my place.
We&#8217;ll go right over from school. You go this
way, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The throng at the corner had broken up, and
the two were practically alone. Dale nodded and
mechanically fell into step. He had been steeling
himself for something so very different that in a
second his defenses were swept entirely away.
Ward&#8217;s perfect assurance of his readiness to play
made even hesitation seem the action of a selfish
cad unwilling to do his best for his troop. Besides,
Dale did not want to refuse&#8211;now.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it you never thought of being a scout
before?&#8221; asked Ward, as they cut across corners
toward Main Street. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there any troop
where you came from?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale shook his head. &#8220;No; and after we got
here Father&#8211;didn&#8217;t want me to join. He&#8211;he
didn&#8217;t seem to understand about it, and so&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused; Ward nodded comprehendingly.
&#8220;Sometimes they don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all
right now. You&#8217;re in, and you don&#8217;t look like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
chap who&#8217;d stay a tenderfoot long, especially with
a scoutmaster like Mr. Curtis. He&#8217;s a corker, all
right, and does everything to help a fellow along.
I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if you&#8217;d be ready for second-class
exams as soon as the month is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s eyes brightened. &#8220;I&#8217;ll certainly try
&#8217;em, anyhow. I can pass a lot of the tests now,
I think, and I&#8217;m going to bone up on the others
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy!&#8221; smiled Sherman. &#8220;If I can
help you in anything, let me know. Well, this is
my corner. So long. Don&#8217;t forget practice at
three-thirty sharp.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he turned down Main
Street, leaving Dale to stare after him for a moment
or two, an odd expression on his freckled
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s&#8211;he&#8217;s not a bit what I&#8211; He&#8217;s
just like&#8211;&#8221; He ended with a deep-drawn breath
and turned homeward, head high and shoulders
squared.</p>

<p>Somehow the blue of the sky seemed suddenly
deeper, the sunshine brighter than it had been before.
The crisp, clean autumn air had a tang in
it he had not noticed until this moment. He drew
it into his lungs in great gulps, and his eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;The pants&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he murmured to himself;
&#8220;so will the jersey. I haven&#8217;t any decent shoes,
but I&#8217;ve played in sneakers before. And there&#8217;ll
be time to deliver the papers after five.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON THE GRIDIRON</span></h2>

<p>Ranny Phelps left the school building
that afternoon in a distinctly disagreeable
mood. He had been feeling vaguely irritable all
day, but since noon there had developed grouchy
tendencies, as Court Parker termed them, and he
was ready to flare up at the slightest provocation.
On the way down-stairs he had flown out at Harry
Vedder, one of his particular followers, for no
other reason than that the stout youth expressed
an indolent conviction that the new tenderfoot
could play football better than he could drill, and
that he would probably show up on the field. The
blow-up, instead of relieving pressure, as such
things often do, seemed to deepen Phelps&#8217;s discontent,
and seeing Ward on the walk just ahead
of him, he yielded to a sudden impulse and hastily
caught up with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Sherm,&#8221; he began hastily, &#8220;you&#8217;re
not really thinking of&#8211;of&#8211;using that nut Tompkins,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The football captain glanced sidewise at him&#8211;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
cool, level stare. &#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked briefly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a member of the troop, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny realized his mistake, but temper kept him
to it. &#8220;Oh, yes! yes, of course,&#8221; he snapped petulantly.
&#8220;Unfortunately he is, but I don&#8217;t see
why you should encourage him. If he&#8217;s shown
that he&#8211;he&#8211;isn&#8217;t wanted, he may have the wit to&#8211;to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Conscious of Ward&#8217;s prolonged, quizzical glance,
the blond chap faltered, and then, furious at himself
and with his companion, he went on angrily:
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t look like that. You know yourself
he&#8217;s the extreme limit. Look at him now!&#8221; He
waved one hand jerkily toward a group ahead,
which included the boy under discussion chatting
eagerly with Parker and Bob Gibson. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
disgrace to the troop with that horrible-looking
suit, all rags and frayed, and&#8211;and his hair brushing
all over his collar; I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been
cut in months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221; inquired the taller chap
composedly, as Ranny paused for breath.
&#8220;What&#8217;s his hair or his clothes got to do with his
being a good scout?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything!&#8221; snapped Ranny, biting his lips
and striving to keep down his temper. &#8220;A fellow
that amounts to anything will&#8211;will keep himself
decent looking even if he is&#8211;poor. Besides he&#8211;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
saw him last night; couldn&#8217;t do the simplest
thing without making a show of himself. Take
my word for it, he&#8217;ll never amount to anything.
He&#8217;s a dead loss, and I wish&#8211; I can&#8217;t think what
you see in&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off with grating teeth, maddeningly
conscious of the futility and ineffectiveness of his
words. It wasn&#8217;t at all the sort of thing he had
meant to say. He realized that temper had deadened
judgment, and that the whole must sound
excessively silly and childish. He fully expected
his companion to greet the outbreak with open
ridicule, but when he looked up, he discovered
with mingled annoyance and relief that Ward
wasn&#8217;t listening at all. Instead, he was staring
at the group ahead with an expression of such
frank curiosity and interest that instinctively
Ranny followed the direction of his schoolmate&#8217;s
eager glance.</p>

<p>Eight or ten boys, mostly upper-grade grammar-school
students and about half of them scouts,
were bunched together at the corner of a cross-street.
Apparently they had been halted by a man
of middle age who was talking with considerable
animation, the while keeping one hand on the
shoulder of Dale Tompkins, who looked exceedingly
sheepish and uncomfortable. As Ranny
stared, puzzled, he was amazed to see Court
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
Parker leap suddenly at his classmate with a piercing
yell, clutch him about the waist, and execute a
few steps of a wildly eccentric war-dance. Then
he thumped the tenderfoot violently on the back,
and finally the whole crowd flung themselves on
the boy in a body. As Ward and Phelps hastily
approached, the victim was engulfed by numbers,
but his vehement, embarrassed protests sounded
intermittently above the din.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, quit it, fellows! Lay off, won&#8217;t you? It
wasn&#8217;t anything. I&#8211; Cut it out&#8211;do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the missing hero!&#8221; called Court Parker,
shrilly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the leather medal?&#8221;
Suddenly he slid out of the throng and faced the
new-comers, his eyes shining. &#8220;What do you
know about Tommy?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;<i>He&#8217;s</i> the
mysterious guy who rescued Georgie Warren last
night. Fact! Mr. Pegram was there and saw
him. He was the one who &#8217;phoned the company
to shut off the current, you know. Says Tommy
was cool as a cucumber and had all kinds of nerve
And this morning he never let out a peep about
it, even when I asked him. Some kid, eh, Sherm?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ward grinned. &#8220;The secretive young beggar!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;By jinks! That ought to
mean a medal, sure! And he a tenderfoot only
a week!&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i2'></a><img src='images/illus2.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Aw, quit it, fellows! It wasn&#8217;t anything&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>He moved forward toward the throng, eager for
further details. Ranny did not stir. His face
was blank, and his mind, usually so active, failed
for a second or two to take in the meaning of
what he had heard. When at length he realized
the truth, a sense of grudging admiration stole
over him. From one of those present at the affair
last night he had had an unusually vivid account
of the accident. He understood the risks the hitherto
unknown rescuer had run, and fully appreciated
his nerve and resourcefulness. For a flashing
second he was filled with an impulse to follow
Ward&#8217;s example and add his brief word of
congratulation to the chorus, but the impulse was
only momentary. In a second or two he had
crushed it back, passed the noisy group, and
headed toward the football field alone.</p>

<p>How absurd he had been even to think of such
a thing! The details had probably been greatly
exaggerated. Doubtless, Tompkins had merely
blundered into the affair and done the right thing
through sheer fool luck. At any rate, he still remained
precisely the same individual whose
presence Ranny had considered a blot on the appearance
of the troop and likely to injure its
&#8220;tone.&#8221; There seemed to him no reason why this
latest development should alter his treatment of
the fellow a particle.</p>

<p>Ward and the rest reached the field not long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
after Phelps, and no time was lost in commencing
practice. Tompkins was started off with the
scrub, an organization composed mostly of scouts
who were too small or lazy or indifferent or unskilful
to make the regular eleven, together with
a few outsiders who had been persuaded into
lending their aid merely for the fun of the game.
It was a motley crowd, and Sherman had his hands
full holding them together. One or two, to be
sure, were stimulated by the hope, which grew
fainter with each day of practice, that they might
supplant some member of the regular team in time
to play in <i>the</i> game of the season, the struggle
with the redoubtable Troop One, which would end
the series and decide the championship. But the
majority had no such dominating incentive.
Their interest flagged continually, and it was only
by a constant appeal to their scout spirit, by rebuke
and ridicule, interspersed with well-timed
jollying, that they could be kept to the scratch.
When Dale Tompkins was given the position of
right tackle, the boy whose place he had taken
openly rejoiced, and not a few of his companions
viewed the escape with envy.</p>

<p>The regulars started with the ball, and the first
down netted them eight yards. The second plunge
through the line was almost as successful; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
third even more so. The scrub played apathetically,
each fellow for himself. They lacked cohesion,
and many of the individuals opposed the
rushes half-heartedly and without spirit. Little
Saunders, the scrub quarter, while working at full
pressure himself, seemed to have grown discouraged
by past failures to spur the fellows on. Occasionally
he snapped out a rasping appeal for
them to get together and do something, but there
was a perfunctory note in his voice which told how
little faith he had in their obeying.</p>

<p>To Ward, playing at left half on the regulars,
it was an old story which had ceased, almost, to
fret him. He had come to feel that the utmost
he could hope for was to keep the scrub together
and gain what practice was possible from their
half-hearted resistance. Keeping his eye on
Tompkins, he noted with approval that the boy
was playing a very different sort of game. He
flung himself into the fray with snap and energy,
tackling well, recovering swiftly, and showing a
pretty knowledge of interference. But it was
soon apparent that his work failed more or less
because of its very quickness. At every rush he
was a foot or two ahead of the sluggish Vedder at
guard or the discouraged Morris playing on his
right. He might get his man and frequently did,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
but one player cannot do all the work of a team,
and the holes in the line remained as gaping as
before.</p>

<p>The regulars scored a touchdown and, returning
to the center of the field, began the process
anew. There was a sort of monotonous iteration
about their advance that presently began to get
a little on Sherman&#8217;s nerves. The crisp, shrill
voice of Court Parker calling the signal, the thud
of feet over the turf, the crash as the wedge of
bodies struck the wavering line and thrust its way
through it and on, on, seemingly to endless distance
in spite of the plucky efforts of the boy at
right tackle to stop it&#8211;it was all so cut and dried,
so certain, so unvaried. Now and again would
come the tired, ill-tempered snap of Saunders&#8217;s
&#8220;Get into it, fellows! Wake up, for the love of
Pete!&#8221; Occasionally, from left end, Ranny
Phelps would make some sarcastic reference to
Ward&#8217;s &#8220;great find,&#8221; to which, though it irritated
him, the captain paid no heed. He was still watching
critically and beginning to wonder, with a little
touch of anxiety, whether Tompkins was going to
be engulfed in the general slough of inertia. In
this wise the play had progressed half-way toward
the scrub&#8217;s goal-posts when suddenly a new note
was injected into the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, fellows. Let&#8217;s get together. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
just as easy to fight back as to be walked over&#8211;and
a lot more fun. Hold &#8217;em, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice was neither shrill nor snappish, but
pitched in a sort of good-natured urgency. One
guessed that the owner of it was growing weary
of being eternally buffeted and flung aside.
Ranny Phelps greeted the remark with a sarcastic
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great head!&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;You must be quite
an expert in the game. Why don&#8217;t you try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale Tompkins raised his head and dashed one
hand across a dripping forehead. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re going to do,&#8221; he smiled; &#8220;aren&#8217;t we, Morris,
old man? Come ahead, Vedder; all we need
is a little team-work, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stout Harry Vedder merely grunted breathlessly.
But somehow, when the next rush came,
his fat shoulders dropped a little lower and he
lunged forward a shade more swiftly than he had
done. Wilks, the weakest point in the opposing
line, caught unexpectedly by the elephantine rush,
went down, and Tompkins brought the man with
the ball to earth by a nice tackle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff,&#8221; he gasped as he scrambled
up. &#8220;Good boy! I knew you&#8217;d do it. Again,
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The regulars scored another touchdown, but it
took longer than the first. Insensibly the line in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
front of them was stiffening. The backs got into
the game; the left wing, stirred by a touch of
rivalry, perhaps, began to put a little snap into
their work. By the time the regulars had forced
the pigskin for the third time over their opponent&#8217;s
goal-line, the scrub seemed actually to be
waking up. Vedder grumbled continually, but
nevertheless he worked; many of the others blustered
a bit to cover their change of tactics. It
was as if they were doubtfully testing out Tompkins&#8217;s
statement that it was more fun to fight back
than to be walked over, and finding an unexpected
pleasure in the process.</p>

<p>Amazed at first, Sherman Ward lost no time in
helping along the good work. After the third
down he gave the scrub the ball and urged them
to make the other fellows hustle. They took him
up with a will. Saunders&#8217;s perfunctory bark became
snappy and full of life; more than one of the
hitherto grouchy players added his voice to the
general racket. But through it all, the good-natured
urgence of Dale Tompkins, with that underlying
note of perfect faith in their willingness
to try anything, continued to stir the fellows to
their best efforts. The swiftly falling autumn twilight
found the regulars fighting harder than they
had ever done before to hold back the newly galvanized
scrub. To the latter it brought a novel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
sensation. For the first time on record they were
almost sorry to see the end of practice.</p>

<p>Streaking across the field to the shed which had
been fixed up for a dressing-room, they laughed,
and joked, and vehemently discussed the latter
plays.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till to-morrow!&#8221; shrilly advised one of
the scrub. &#8220;We won&#8217;t do a thing to you guys,
will we, Tommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; agreed Tompkins, smilingly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make &#8217;em hump, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed quite unconscious of having done
anything in the least out of the ordinary. On the
contrary, he was filled with grateful happiness at
the subtle change in the manner of many of the
fellows toward him. It wasn&#8217;t that they praised
his playing. Except Sherman, who briefly commended
him, no one actually mentioned that. But
instead of Tompkins, they called him Tommy;
they jollied and joshed him, argued and disputed
and chaffed with a boisterous friendliness as if he
had never been anything else than one of them.
And the tenderfoot, hustling into his clothes that
he might make haste to start out with his papers,
glowed inwardly, responding to the treatment as
a flower opens before the sun.</p>

<p>From the background Ranny Phelps observed
it all with silent thoughtfulness. Quick-witted as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
he was, it did not take long for him to realize the
changed conditions, to understand that he could
not longer treat the new-comer with open, careless
insolence as a fellow who did not count. But
far from altering his opinion of Tompkins, the
new developments merely served to strengthen
his dislike, which speedily crystallized into a determination
to do some active campaigning against
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a swelled head added to all the rest, he&#8217;ll
be simply intolerable,&#8221; decided Phelps. &#8220;I guess
I&#8217;ve got a little influence left with the crowd in
spite of all this rot.&#8221; His eyes narrowed ominously
as they rested on Harry Vedder chatting affably
with the cause of Ranny&#8217;s ill temper. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
start with you, my fat friend,&#8221; he muttered contemptuously
under his breath. &#8220;You need a good
jacking-up before you indulge in any more foolishness.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>TROUBLE AHEAD</span></h2>

<p>In spite of all that had happened that day, Dale
did not forget his appointment with Mr. Curtis.
He hurried through supper, and pausing only to
tell his mother where he was going, he slipped
out of the house and started at a trot toward the
scoutmaster&#8217;s house. Mr. Curtis himself opened
the door, greeted the boy cheerily, and ushered
him into a room on the left of the hall, a room
lined with books and pictures, with a fire glowing
and sputtering on the hearth and some comfortable
arm-chairs drawn up beside it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young man,&#8221; he said briskly as soon as
Dale was seated, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been hearing things about
you this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale flushed, and his fingers unconsciously interlocked.
The affair of the afternoon before had
been &#8220;rubbed into him&#8221; at intervals all day, so
that he almost dreaded further comment. It
seemed as if it had been talked about quite enough
and ought now be allowed to fall into oblivion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
He hoped Mr. Curtis wasn&#8217;t going to ask him to
go over all the details again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have managed admirably,&#8221; went
on the scoutmaster, in a matter-of-face manner.
&#8220;What I&#8217;d like to know, though, is how you, a
tenderfoot of barely a week&#8217;s standing, happened
to be so well posted on electricity and insulation
and all the rest of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8211;it&#8217;s in the handbook,&#8221; explained Dale,
haltingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; smiled the scoutmaster; &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t
a part of the tenderfoot requirements. I even
doubt whether many second-class scouts would be
up on it. Have you gone through the whole book
as thoroughly?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale leaned back in his chair more easily. &#8220;Oh
no, sir, not all! But that part&#8217;s specially interesting,
and I&#8211;I like to read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Well, it was a good stunt&#8211;a mighty
good stunt! It&#8217;s the sort of thing true scouting
stands for, and I&#8217;m proud of you.&#8221; In his glance
there was something that told a good deal more
than the words themselves, but somehow Dale
didn&#8217;t mind that. &#8220;I suppose, though, you&#8217;ve
been hearing nothing else all day and must be
rather tired of it, so we&#8217;ll go on to this drill business.
This is only one feature of our work, and
perhaps the least important since we&#8217;re a nonmilitary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
organization. But it helps set a fellow
up, it teaches him obedience and quick thinking,
and is useful in a number of other ways, so we&#8217;ve
included it in the program. The movements
aren&#8217;t intricate. Suppose you take that cane over
in the corner, and I&#8217;ll go through them with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale obeyed promptly, and, returning with the
article in question, stood facing the scoutmaster,
who had also risen. With the feeling of being
under inspection, he had naturally taken a good
position, shoulders back and chin up, and Mr. Curtis
nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea!&#8221; he said. &#8220;With the command
&#8216;Attention!&#8217; you take practically that position,
heels together, shoulders back, chin up, and
eyes straight ahead. Hold the staff upright with
the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand,
one end on the ground and the upper part against
your right shoulder. That&#8217;s the attitude you return
to after each one of the movements. Now
let&#8217;s try the first one.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were not more than six or seven of these,
and the scoutmaster&#8217;s instructions were so clear
and explicit that Dale wondered, with a touch of
chagrin, how he could possibly have bungled so on
the night of the meeting. In less than half an
hour he had the different evolutions fixed firmly
in his mind and the cane was laid aside.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better run through them every night
for ten minutes or so until they come intuitively,
without your having to stop and think,&#8221; advised
the scoutmaster. &#8220;The main thing is to put snap
and ginger into it, so that the whole line moves as
one. How did the football go? You were out,
weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; the boy answered, his eyes lighting.
&#8220;It was dandy! It&#8217;s a crackerjack team, all
right, and we&#8217;re going to work like sixty to get
that pennant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea!&#8221; smiled Mr. Curtis. He had
returned to his chair, but the boy remained standing
beside the table. &#8220;It will mean work to take
the game from Troop One; they&#8217;ve a corking
team, you know. But I think if&#8211; Won&#8217;t you
sit down again, or have you lessons to get?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale hesitated. The pleasant room with its
glinting fire was very tempting. He had glimpsed
a number of interesting-looking old weapons and
pieces of Indian beadwork, too, on the walls or arranged
along the tops of the bookcases, which he
would like to examine more closely. But, on the
other hand, eight waiting problems in algebra and
some stiff pages of grammar loomed up to dissuade
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, sir, but I guess I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
better not to-night,&#8221; he finally decided. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t anything done yet for to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come again, then,&#8221; smiled the scoutmaster.
&#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to have you boys drop
in, even when you haven&#8217;t anything special to talk
over. Good night; and good luck with the football.
I may see you at practice to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale found it hard to wait for that moment.
He was devoted to football, and he had not really
played in almost a year. Small wonder, therefore,
that he looked forward eagerly to even humdrum
practice. He did not propose to stay on the scrub
if hard work and constant effort could lift him to
something better. But even if he failed of advancement,
he loved the game enough for its own
sake to give to it unceasingly the best that was in
him.</p>

<p>As the days passed it began to look as if the
pleasure he got merely in playing and in the belief
that his efforts contributed a little to the good of
the team was to be his sole reward. All that week
he played left tackle on the scrub, save for half an
hour or so on Friday when Ward tried him at right
half, only to return him presently to his former
position.</p>

<p>But if Dale was disappointed, he did not show
it. He told himself that it was too soon to expect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
anything else. Sherman would naturally wish to
try him out in every way before making a change
in the line-up. So the tenderfoot kept himself vigorously
to the scratch, growing more and more
familiar with the various formations and carefully
studying the methods of the fellows opposite him.</p>

<p>It was this latter occupation which brought the
first faint touch of uneasiness regarding the
strength of the team at large. He could not be
quite sure, for of course ordinary practice seldom
brings out the best in a player, but it seemed as
if the fellows were a bit lacking in unity and cohesion.
Of one thing at least he grew certain before
he had been on the scrub two days. Wilks,
at left tackle, was hesitating and erratic, with a
tendency to ducking, which would have been even
more apparent but for the constant support and
backing of Ranny Phelps. The latter seemed not
only able to play his own position with dash and
brilliancy, but also to lend a portion of his strength
and skill to support the wavering tackle. Whenever
it was possible, he contrived to take a little
more than his share of buffeting in the forward
plunge, to bear the brunt of each attack. There
were times, of course&#8211;notably when Ranny himself
carried the ball&#8211;that this was impossible,
and then it was that Wilks&#8217;s shrinking became unmistakable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s got cold feet,&#8221; decided Tompkins, with
the mild wonder of one to whom the game had
never brought anything but exhilaration and delight.
&#8220;They must be mighty good friends for
Phelps to help him out like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed a little wistfully. Ranny was letting
no chance slip these days to show his disapproval
of the newest member of the troop. There were
others, too, who followed his example and treated
the tenderfoot with marked coldness. Even stout
Harry Vedder, though occasionally forgetting
himself in the heat of play, lacked the good-natured
friendliness of that first day. To be sure,
these were far from being a majority. They included
practically only the members of Ranny
Phelps&#8217;s own patrol; the others had apparently
accepted Tompkins as one of the bunch and continued
to treat him as such. But Dale&#8217;s was a
friendly nature, and it troubled him a little, when
he had time to think about it, to be the object of
even a passive hostility.</p>

<p>These moments, however, were few and far between.
What with football every afternoon, with
lessons and occasional studying for the second-class
tests, to say nothing of his paper-route and
some extra delivery-work he had undertaken to
add to his &#8220;suit&#8221; money, his days were pretty full.
Besides, that doubt as to the entire efficiency of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
team continued to worry him much more than any
small personal trouble.</p>

<p>On Saturday they played Troop Six, and Dale
sat among the substitutes on the side-lines. It
was an admirable chance for sizing up the playing
of the team as a whole, and before the end of the
second quarter his freckled forehead was puckered
with worried lines. He had no fear of their losing
the game. Their opponents had notoriously the
weakest team in the entire scout league, and already
two goals had been scored against it. The
tenderfoot was thinking of next Saturday, and
wondering more and more what sort of a showing
the fellows would make then.</p>

<p>Earlier in the season, Dale had watched Troop
One throughout an entire game, and even then he
had noted their clever team-work. As individuals,
perhaps, they might not match up to his own organization.
There was no one quite to equal the
brilliant Ranny Phelps, the clever quick-witted
Ward, or the dependable Wesley Becker at full.
But the boy knew football well enough to realize
that in the long run it isn&#8217;t the individual that
counts. Freak plays, snatching at chance and the
unexpected, may sometimes win a game, but as a
rule they avail little against the spirit of cohesion
when each fellow works shoulder to shoulder with
his neighbor, supporting, backing up, subordinating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
himself and the thought of individual glory to
the needs of the team. During the past week Dale
had felt vaguely that it was just this quality Troop
Five lacked. Now the certainty was vividly
brought home, with all the advantages of a sharp
perspective. The center, alone, seemed fairly
strong and united, with Bob Gibson in the middle
&#8220;Turk&#8221; Gardner at right guard, and Frank Sanson
at left. But Sanson got no help at all from
Wilks, who, in his turn, took everything from
Ranny Phelps. Court Parker made an admirable
quarter-back, and Ward and Becker played the
game as it should be played. But Slater at right
tackle and Torrance behind him made another pair
who seemed to think more of each other and of
their individual success than of the unity of the
team. They were great chums, Dale reflected
thoughtfully, and in Ranny Phelps&#8217;s patrol. He
wondered if that had anything to do with it. He
wondered, too, whether Sherman realized the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course he does!&#8221; he muttered an instant
later. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he always after them to get
together, though sometimes it seems as if he might
go for them a little harder? I&#8211;I hope they do&#8211;before
it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>But somehow he could not bring himself to be
very confident. To pull together a team that has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
been playing &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; is one of
the hardest things in the world. Defeat will often
do it more thoroughly than anything, but, in their
case, defeat would mean the loss of all they had
been striving for. It would have been better had
they been up against any other team to-day.
Pushed hard and forced to fight for a slender victory,
they might have realized something of their
weakness. But the very ease with which goal after
goal was scored brought self-confidence and
cock-sureness instead of wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll grab that little old pennant, all
right,&#8221; Dale heard more than one declare in the
dressing-room. &#8220;Why, those dubs actually scored
a goal on Troop One!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy wanted to remind them that this was
at the very beginning of the season, and since
then two of their best men had left Troop Six
for boarding-school. But from a raw tenderfoot
and inconsidered member of the scrub any such
comment would savor of cheekiness, so he kept
silent.</p>

<p>On Monday the practice started out in such a
casual, perfunctory manner that Sherman suddenly
stopped the play and lashed out, sparing nobody.
He was white-hot, and not hesitating to
mention names, he told them just what he thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
of their smug complaisance, their careless, unfounded
confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows seem to think all you have to do is
to show up on the field Saturday and the other
crowd are going to take to cover!&#8221; he snapped.
&#8220;You walk through the plays without an idea of
team-work, or mutual support, or anything. That
isn&#8217;t football; it&#8217;s just plain foolishness! Why,
the lines are as full of holes as a colander&#8211;and
you don&#8217;t even know it! I tell you, unless we get
together and stop those gaps and work for the
team <i>right</i>, that game Saturday will be a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated an instant, striving for self-control.
When he went on, his tone was slightly moderated.
&#8220;Come ahead, now, fellows; let&#8217;s get into
it and do the thing the way it should be done. We
can if we only will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the appeal failed more or less
because of its very force. Sherman&#8217;s one fault
as a captain was a certain leniency of disposition.
He was a bit easy-going, and preferred to handle
the fellows by persuasion rather than force. The
latter did not realize that it wasn&#8217;t the happenings
of that day alone which had so roused his wrath,
that these were only the culmination of all their
shortcomings for weeks past, that they had been
accumulating until the pressure became so great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
that an explosion had to come. A few of the players
understood, but the very ones who needed his
advice the most set down the outburst to whim or
temper or indigestion. Either they airily ignored
it, or else grew sullen and grouchy. In either case
they failed to make a personal application of his
words, and the situation remained practically unchanged.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE QUARREL</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Great cats and little kittens!&#8221; exclaimed
Court Parker, stopping suddenly beside the
flagpole on the green. &#8220;I certainly am a chump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you say,&#8221; grinned the tenderfoot.
&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to contradict you. How&#8217;d you happen
to find it out all by yourself, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were on their way to the scout meeting, and
up to that moment had been deep in a serious discussion
of the football situation. But Parker was
not one to remain serious for very long at a
stretch, so his sudden outbreak failed to surprise
Dale, even though he might be ignorant of its
cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I had it all planned to coach you up on
the drill this week, so you could put one over on
Ranny,&#8221; explained the volatile youth, as they
started on again; &#8220;but I clean forgot. Hang it
all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale smiled quietly to himself. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if I could get it to-night,&#8221; he said briefly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not so awful hard, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;N-n-o, but you know Ranny; he&#8217;s sure to try
and trip you up. Oh, well, no use crying over spilt
milk! Just don&#8217;t let him rattle you, and we&#8217;ll
have you letter-perfect by next meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s lips twitched again, but he made no further
comment as they hurried along Main Street
and turned in beside the church. It was with very
different feelings from the last time that he entered
the parish-house, hung up his cap, and joined
one of the groups gathered in the meeting-room.
He was still the only one present without a uniform,
but to-night he wore his best suit, his hair
was smooth and glistening, and he could almost
see himself in the brilliant polish of his shoes. It
all helped to increase his poise and the feeling of
self-confidence his knowledge of the drill had given
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis was away that night, and Wesley
Becker was in charge. The assistant scoutmaster
was perfectly capable of conducting the meeting,
but being only a year or two older than many
of the boys, it was inevitable that discipline should
tend to relax slightly. There were no serious infractions,
of course; the fellows, as a whole, were
too well trained and too much in earnest for that.
But now and then a suppressed snicker followed
the utterance of a whispered jest, and Wesley had
occasionally to repeat his orders before they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
obeyed with the snap and precision that invariably
followed the commands of Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>Dale was not one of the offenders, if such they
could be called. In the beginning he was too intent
on going through the newly acquired evolutions
of the drill to have much thought for anything
else. Later on, the behavior of Ranny
Phelps took all his attention.</p>

<p>The leader of Wolf patrol was far from being
in the best of humors. Perhaps the events of the
afternoon had soured his temper; or possibly the
mere sight of Tompkins standing erect at the end
of the line made him realize that his efforts to put
the tenderfoot in his place had been more or less of
a failure. At any rate, when staves were distributed
and the drill commenced, he at once renewed
his nagging, critical attacks of the week before.</p>

<p>For a time Dale tried not to notice it, trusting
that his careful, accurate execution of the man&oelig;uvers
would in itself be enough to still the unjust
criticism. But presently he began to realize
that Phelps was deliberately blind to his improvement,
and a touch of angry color crept into
his face. In the next figure he made a minor slip,
and a snicker from Wilks increased Dale&#8217;s irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your time, Tompkins, by all means,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
urged Phelps, sarcastically, when Becker ordered
a repetition of the movement. &#8220;Maybe by the
end of the evening you&#8217;ll be able to do one of the
figures half-way right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s lips parted impulsively, but closed again
without a sound issuing forth. A dull, smoldering
anger began to glow within him, and one hand
gripped his staff tightly. What right had Ranny
Phelps to shame and humiliate him before the
whole troop? He was doing his best, and he felt
that the showing wasn&#8217;t such a bad one for a fellow
who had been in the troop little more than
a week. Any decent chap would have understood
this and made allowances, would even have helped
him along instead of trying by every means in his
power to make him fail. Dale&#8217;s chin went up a
trifle, and his teeth clenched. By a great effort
he managed to hold himself in for the remainder
of the drill, but the anger and irritation bubbling
up inside resulted in several more errors. When
the drill was over and the fellows stood at ease for
a few minutes before starting some signal-work,
Phelps strode over to the new recruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Tompkins?&#8221; he
said with cold sarcasm. &#8220;At this rate, you&#8217;re
likely to spend the whole winter getting a few simple
stunts into your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;It might not be a bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
idea to learn a few of the scout laws yourself,&#8221; he
snapped back impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny&#8217;s voice was cool and level, but his eyes
had narrowed and a spot of color glowed on each
cheek. The fellows near them suddenly pricked
up their ears and turned curiously in their direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea for you to
learn some of the scout laws,&#8221; repeated Dale, heedless
of everything save the anger and indignation
surging up within him. &#8220;There&#8217;s one about being
friendly, and another that says a scout is helpful.
Maybe you know them by heart, but I don&#8217;t believe&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221; cut in Ranny, harshly. &#8220;I certainly
don&#8217;t need any advice from <i>you</i> on how
to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you won&#8217;t <i>take</i> any,&#8221; interrupted
Dale, hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patrols, attention!&#8221; rang out Becker&#8217;s voice
sharply.</p>

<p>Neither of the boys paid any heed; it is doubtful
whether they even heard him. Tight-lipped,
with fists clenched, they glared at one another
from eyes that snapped angrily. In another moment,
however, Becker gripped Phelps tightly by
the shoulder and whirled him around.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;Cut that out and go back to your place!&#8221; he
said sternly. &#8220;I called for order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny glowered at him for a moment, and then,
without a word, turned on his heel and strode back
to the head of the line. In the hush that followed,
Dale drew a long breath and swallowed hard. His
face still burned, and the fingers of his right hand
were stiff and cramped from the grip he had unconsciously
maintained on his staff. With an
elaborate attempt at nonchalance, he listened to
Becker&#8217;s directions about the signaling, but all the
while he was wondering what the fellows thought
of him and wishing, with increasing fervency, that
he had kept his self-control instead of flaring up
in that foolish way.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the evening Phelps seemed
coolly oblivious of Dale&#8217;s existence. He did not
even glance at the tenderfoot, though on the way
out the two stood for a moment within arm&#8217;s-length
in the entry. He had apparently quite recovered
his composure, but there was a cold hardness
about his mouth that brought a queer, unexpected
pang to Tompkins.</p>

<p>Not for the world would he have acknowledged
it to any one&#8211;even to Court, who, with several
others, expressed unqualified approval of the way
in which Ranny had been &#8220;set down.&#8221; It is
doubtful, even, had he been given a chance to live
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
over the evening, if his conduct would have been
any different. But there could be no question of
his keen regret that instead of thawing Phelps&#8217;s
coolness by his increased proficiency at the drill,
he had only succeeded in vastly increasing the
boy&#8217;s animosity.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon Dale was made the
unconscious cause of still further adding to Ranny&#8217;s
ire. After half an hour of play, Ward suddenly
ordered Larry Wilks out of the line-up and
told Tompkins to take his place.</p>

<p>At the command the tackle started, stared incredulously
at Sherman, and then, with lowering
brow and an exaggerated air of indifference,
turned and walked deliberately off the field. For
an instant Ranny stood silent, a deep red flaming
into his face. Then he whirled impulsively on
Ward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy, Sherm?&#8221; he demanded hotly.
&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ll queer the whole team by sticking in
a greenhorn only three days before the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&#8221; retorted Ward,
curtly. He spoke quietly enough, but a faint
twitching at the corners of his mouth showed that
he was holding himself in with difficulty. &#8220;Wilks
has had plenty of warnings, and has seen fit to
disregard them utterly. Besides,&#8221; his voice took
in a harder tone as his eyes followed the departing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
player he had counted on using in the scrub,
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather use anybody&#8211;little Bennie Rhead,
even&#8211;than a fellow who shows the lack of spirit
he does. Take your place, Tompkins. Frazer,
shift over to right tackle on the scrub. Edwards,
you come in and play left guard for to-day. Scrub
has the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny Phelps bit his lip, glared ill-temperedly,
and then subsided. Tompkins shifted over to the
regulars, his mind a queer turmoil of delight at the
advancement, and regret and apprehension at this
new cause for bickering among the players. Practice
was resumed, but there was a notable feeling
of constraint among the fellows, which did not entirely
pass off as the afternoon wore away.
Ranny held himself coldly aloof, playing his own
position with touches of the old brilliancy, but ignoring
the chap beside him. Torrance and Slater,
and one or two of the scrub who were part of the
Phelps clique, whispered occasionally among themselves,
or darted indignant glances at the tenderfoot
as if he were in some way responsible for the
downfall of Wilks. Dale tried not to notice it all,
and devoted himself vigorously to playing the
game, hoping that by the next day the fellows
would cool down and get together.</p>

<p>But somehow they didn&#8217;t. There had been
time for discussion with the disgruntled Wilks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
himself, and if anything, their animosity was increased.
It was so marked, and the effect so disastrous,
or so it seemed to Tompkins, to the unity
of the team, that after practice the tenderfoot
hesitatingly approached Sherman Ward. It was
not at all easy for him to say what he had in mind.
For one thing, the idea of even remotely advising
the captain savored of cheekiness and presumption;
for another, he wasn&#8217;t personally at all keen
to take the step he felt would be for the good of
the team. But at length he summoned courage to
make the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Sherm,&#8221; he began haltingly, after walking
beside Ward for a few moments in silence,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think&#8211;that is, would it be better for
me to&#8211;er&#8211;not to play to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sherman stopped short in surprise. &#8220;Not
play?&#8221; he repeated sharply. &#8220;Why, what&#8211;&#8221;
He frowned suddenly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Want to?</i> Of course I do! But it seems to
me things would&#8211;would go smoother if&#8211;I wasn&#8217;t
in the line-up. You know some of the fellows&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Sherman&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;Oh,
that&#8217;s what you mean, is it?&#8221; For an instant he
stood staring silently at the freckled face raised
to his. &#8220;You&#8217;d be willing to get out for&#8211;for the
good of the team?&#8221; As Dale nodded he reached
out and caught the boy almost roughly by one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
shoulder. &#8220;Forget it!&#8221; he said gruffly. &#8220;I know
what I&#8217;m doing, kid. You go in to-morrow and
play up for all you&#8217;re worth. If&#8211;if those chumps
don&#8217;t come to their senses, it won&#8217;t be your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>His jaw was square; his lips firm. It flashed
suddenly on Dale that Sherman couldn&#8217;t very well
follow his suggestion and continue to preserve a
shred of authority as captain. It would seem as
if he were giving in to the delinquents and allowing
them to run the team. They would set him
down as weak and vacillating, and pay less attention
than ever to his efforts to make them get together
and play the game right. A sudden anger
flamed up within the tenderfoot, and his teeth
clicked together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chumps!&#8221; he growled to himself, his fists
clenching. &#8220;Can&#8217;t they see what they&#8217;re doing?
Can&#8217;t they forget themselves for a minute and
think of the team?&#8221;</p>

<p>He wished the suspense was over and the moment
for the game at hand. Hitherto the days
had fairly flown, making the afternoons of much
needed practice incredibly brief, but now the very
minutes seemed to drag. Saturday morning was
interminable. Dale tried to forget his worries by
attending to the various chores about the house,
but even in the midst of vigorous woodchopping
he found himself stopping to think of the struggle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
of the afternoon, going over the different plays
and sizing up the probable behavior of various individuals.</p>

<p>But at last the waiting was over and he had
taken his place in that line which spread out across
the field ready for the signal. And as he crouched
there, back bent, watching with keen, appraising
eyes the blue jersies dotting the turf before him,
the tension relaxed a little, giving place to the
thrall of the game.</p>

<p>After all, why should he be so certain of the
worst? Wasn&#8217;t it quite as likely that the fellows
would be awakened and dominated, even stung
into unity, by the same thrill which moved him?
An instant later he lunged forward and was running
swiftly, madly, his face upturned to the yellow
sphere soaring above his head and rocking
gently in its swooping, dropping flight.</p>

<p>When Ranny Phelps made a perfect catch and
zigzagged down the field, dodging the interference
with consummate skill, the tenderfoot thrilled
responsive and mentally applauded. When the
blond chap was at length downed and the teams
lined up snappily, Dale grinned delightedly to
himself at the realization of the fine beginning
they had made.</p>

<p>But his enthusiasm was short-lived. Parker
ripped out a signal, and the ball was snapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
back to Ward. Dale drove forward, bent on clearing
the way for Sherman. Beside him Ranny
also lunged into the mêlée, but the tenderfoot was
instantly conscious of a gap between them that
seemed as wide as the poles apart. Into it the
solid blue-jerseyed interference thrust itself, and
the forward rush stopped as if it had struck a
stone wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;First down!&#8221; shouted the referee when the
heap of players disintegrated. &#8220;Ten yards to
gain!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE LAST QUARTER</span></h2>

<p>As Dale scrambled to his feet and sought his
place again, his face was flaming. He had a
feeling that he must be partly to blame for the
failure. Perhaps he had been a bit too quick in
his forward lunge. As he crouched in the line,
head low and shoulders bent, his hands clenched
themselves tightly. It mustn&#8217;t happen again, he
told himself.</p>

<p>But swiftly it was borne upon him that the
blame did not lie on his shoulders. A try around
right end brought them barely a yard. Something
had gone wrong there, too. He could not tell just
what it was, but it seemed as if Slater and Torrance
had failed somehow to back up Ted MacIlvaine
as they should have done. The tackle&#8217;s
teeth grated, and a flood of impotent anger surged
over him. They were playing as they had played
in practice, each fellow for himself, without even
an effort to get together and tighten up.</p>

<p>With the inevitable kick which gave the ball to
Troop One, this fact became even more apparent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
Solid and compact, the blue line swept down the
field with a machine-like rush that carried everything
before it. They seemed to find holes everywhere
in the opposing line, and only the handicap
of a high wind and the brilliant work of three or
four individuals kept them from scoring in the
first quarter.</p>

<p>That such a calamity could be long prevented
seemed impossible to Dale. He greeted the intermission
with a sigh of thankfulness. Brief as it
was, it was a respite. Sherman&#8217;s bitter, stinging
onslaught on the team passed almost unheeded by
the anxious tackle. He was thinking of the three
remaining quarters with a foreboding that made
him oblivious to all else.</p>

<p>To be sure, when play was resumed, the fellows
seemed to show a slightly better spirit. It was as
if the first dim realization of their errors was being
forced upon them. But they had been split
apart so long that they seemed to have forgotten
how to work together in that close-knit, united
manner which alone could make any head against
these particular opponents. Time and time again
they were driven back to the very shadow of their
goal-posts, where, stung by shame or the lashing
tongue of their captain, they rallied long enough
to hurl back the attack a little, only to lapse again
when the pressing, vital need was past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>Then, toward the very end of that second quarter,
when Tompkins was just beginning to hope
again, the thing he had dreaded came suddenly
and unexpectedly. Some one blundered, whether
Slater, or Torrance, or Ted MacIlvaine, the boy
did not know. With a last swift rush the blue-clad
interference charged at the right wing,
through it, over it, and, hurling aside all opposition,
swept resistlessly over the last six yards for
a touchdown. They missed the goal by a hair,
but that did not lessen the sense of shock and
sharp dismay which quivered through the line of
their opponents.</p>

<p>Dale Tompkins took his place after the long
intermission, a dull, bitter, impotent anger consuming
him. He was furious with the fellows
who by their incredible stupidity were practically
throwing away the game. He even hated himself
for seeming to accomplish so little; but most of
all he raged at the blond chap next to him. Some
of the others were at least trying to get together,
though their lack of practice made the effort almost
negligible. But Ranny Phelps remained as
coldly aloof, as markedly determined to withhold
support and play his game alone as he had been
in the beginning.</p>

<p>It made a hole in the line which could not escape
the attention of the opposing quarter-back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
Already he had sent his formation through it
more than once, but now he seemed to concentrate
the attack on that weak spot. Time and time
again Dale flung himself to meet the rush, only to
be overwhelmed and hurled back by sheer numbers.
Sometimes Sanson pulled him out of the
scrimmage, more often he scrambled up unaided
to find his place, sweat-blinded and with breath
coming in gasps, and brace himself for the next
onset.</p>

<p>Silently, doggedly, he took his punishment, and
presently, under the strain, he began to lose track
of the broader features of the game. Vaguely he
realized that they had been forced back again and
again almost against their own goal-posts, and
there had rallied, tearing formations to shreds
and hurling back the enemy with the strength of
despair. Dimly he heard the voice of Ward, or
Court Parker&#8217;s shriller notes, urging them in
sharp, broken phrases to get together. But the
real, the dominating thing was that forward
plunge, the tensing of muscles, the crash of
meeting bodies, the heaving, straining struggle,
the slow, heartrending process of being crushed
back by overwhelming weight&#8211;that and the sense
of emptiness upon his left.</p>

<p>Then came a time when things went black for
an instant before his eyes. He did not quite lose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
consciousness, for he knew when the weight above
was lifted and two arms slid around him, dragging
him to his feet. It was Sanson, he thought hazily&#8211;good
old Frank! Then he turned his head a
little and through the wavering mists looked
straight into the eyes of Ranny Phelps!</p>

<p>Wide, dilated, almost black with strain and excitement,
they stared at him from out the grimy
face with a strange mingling of shame and admiration
that sent a thrill through the tenderfoot
and made him pull himself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; came in gruff, unnatural accents.
&#8220;You want to get your wind&#8211;old fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; muttered the tenderfoot.</p>

<p>He passed one hand vaguely across his forehead.
Some one brought a tin dipper, from which
he rinsed his mouth mechanically. His head was
clearing, but he couldn&#8217;t seem to understand
whether the transformation in the chap beside
him was real or only a creation of his bewildered
brain. But when he took his place again and
dropped his shoulders instinctively, another shoulder
pressed against him on the left, and that same
hoarse, unfamiliar voice sounded in his ears:</p>

<p>&#8220;Together now, kid; we&#8217;ll stop &#8217;em this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words seemed to give Dale a new strength.
Stirred to the very fiber of his being, he dived
forward to meet the onward rush. Still with that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
new, stimulating sense of support where none had
been before, his outstretched hands gripped like
tentacles around sturdy legs. There was a heaving,
churning motion; then the compact mass of
players toppled over, and he knew that they had
succeeded.</p>

<p>Nor was it a solitary advantage. Unobserved
by Tompkins, the whole line had been slowly stiffening.
Slowly, gradually, the other holes had
been closed up and the advance checked. When
the kick put the ball in their possession, a new
spirit animated Troop Five. Scattered no longer,
but welded by stern necessity into a single unit,
they forgot their handicap, forgot that the minutes
of the final quarter were speeding in mad
flight, forgot everything but the vital need of
breaking through that line of blue and carrying
the fight toward those distant goal-posts that
loomed so far away.</p>

<p>Forming up swiftly, they swept forward for a
gain of eight yards. Before the opposition recovered
from their surprise, they had passed the
fifty-yard line.</p>

<p>Here the blues rallied, and for a space the two
lines surged back and forth in the middle of the
field. It was a period of small gains and frequent
punts, when neither side held the ball long,
nor the advantage. Thrilled by their success, exhilarated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
by that strange new sense of comradeship
with the boy beside him, Dale fought fiercely,
heedless of the shock of bodies, of pain, of weariness,
of blinding sweat, or hard-won breath. His
only worry was a growing fear that they would
not have time to score, and this had only just
begun to dominate him when the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>They were battling on the enemy&#8217;s forty-yard
line. It was Troop One&#8217;s ball, and they had tried
to force a gain through center. Shoulder to
shoulder, Ranny and Dale plunged forward to
meet the rush. The advance checked, Tompkins
gained his feet swiftly and thrilled to see the
precious ball rolling free not a dozen feet
away.</p>

<p>With a gasp he lunged for it and scooped it up
without slackening speed. At almost the same
instant Ranny Phelps shot out of the scrimmage
as if propelled from a catapult, and a moment
later the two were thudding down the field, a
stream of players trailing in their wake.</p>

<p>Dale caught his breath with the stinging realization
that their chance had come&#8211;their only
chance! There were but two men between them
and the coveted goal, the full-back, and nearer,
another player bearing swiftly down on them,
who must instantly be reckoned with. That would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
be Ranny&#8217;s task. He must stop the fellow, while
Dale took his chance alone with the other.</p>

<p>Dale glanced sideways at his companion, and his
heart leaped into his throat. Phelps was limping;
something had happened to him in that last
scrimmage. His face showed white even through
the grime and tan; his under lip was flecked with
crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ranny!&#8221; gasped Dale, in a panic. &#8220;What&#8211; Can
you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8211;worry&#8211;about&#8211;me,&#8221; came indistinctly
through the other&#8217;s clenched teeth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll&#8211;block&#8211;this
fellow&#8211;somehow. You get the other&#8211;you&#8217;ve
got to!&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking a fresh grip on the ball, Dale spurted
on. He was aware that Ranny had sheered off a
little to the right, and knew that he meant to stop
the boy racing up from that direction. But actually
he saw nothing, and even the crash of meeting
bodies came to him as something far away and
unimportant. His clearing brain was fixed on
the looming figure ahead, the full-back, who alone
stood between him and victory.</p>

<p>He must be passed&#8211;but how? A thought of
hurdling flashed into his mind, to be dismissed as
too hazardous. There was only one way left.
Without slackening speed, he tore on, his heart
thumping like a trip-hammer. To the breathless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
onlookers it seemed as if he meant actually to run
down the opposing player. Then, in a flash, when
he was almost within reach of the hooking arms,
he swerved suddenly to one side, whirled, darted
the other way, eluded the other&#8217;s frantic clutch by
the merest hair, and with a sob of joy ran on,
free, the ball still cupped in the curve of his arm.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOOD TURN</span></h2>

<p>Ten minutes later the small building on the
edge of the field was thronged with joyous,
excited boys in various stages of undress, who
celebrated the victory with shrill jubilations,
snatches of song, or exuberant outbursts of mere
noise. The strain and tension of the afternoon
were forgotten; nobody remembered the nearness
of defeat in the recollection of that last splendid
rally which had brought them all so much closer
together.</p>

<p>On every hand fellows were comparing notes
and talking over details of the struggle in eager
fragments. &#8220;Remember the time&#8211;&#8221; &#8220;Say, how
about that gain through center when Ted&#8211;&#8221;
&#8220;Some run, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you Tommy!&#8221; shrilled Court Parker,
catching Dale&#8217;s eye. &#8220;Awful punk run that was&#8211;simply
awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tompkins smiled back at him, but did not speak.
He was luxuriating in the restful peace which
comes after strenuous physical action and the consciousness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
of successful accomplishment. A feeling
of intense pride in the troop filled him.
&#8220;They&#8217;re a corking lot of fellows&#8211;corking!&#8221; he
said more than once under his breath as he looked
around the room with shining eyes. &#8220;How they
did get after that bunch in the last quarter! I&#8211;I
wouldn&#8217;t belong to any other troop for&#8211;for
anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then, to be sure, his eyes strayed to the
farther end of the room, where Ranny Phelps
was having his swollen ankle bandaged by two of
the most skilful exponents of first aid, and a faint
touch of questioning crept into them. Since that
breathless moment on the field when Ranny&#8217;s efforts
had left the way free for Dale, he had not
spoken to the tenderfoot nor by so much as a
glance recognized his existence. Dale wondered
whether his mind was merely taken up with his injury,
or whether the change that had come over
him in the heat of the game had been only a
temporary thawing.</p>

<p>As the days passed, the latter suspicion became
a certainty. At their very first meeting, in fact,
the tenderfoot found Ranny as aloof as ever. To
be sure, Dale noticed that he no longer seemed to
try to impress his attitude on the others in his
patrol. Apparently without rebuke, stout Harry
Vedder became quite friendly, and even Rex
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Slater and one or two others in the clique treated
him with a good deal more consideration than
they had before the game. But the leader himself
made no effort to disguise his coolness toward the
new-comer, and Dale presently found it hard to
believe that the helping hand, the friendly voice,
the touch of that muscular shoulder as they fought
side by side on the field in the furious struggle
against odds had been real.</p>

<p>He did not brood over it, because he was not
of the brooding sort. More than once he found
himself regretting that impulsive action which
had so increased the other boy&#8217;s antagonism, but
for the most part he contented himself with the
unqualified friendship of most of the troop, and
entered with zest into the various scout activities.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of these were the
long hikes and week-end camping-trips. Mr. Curtis
was a great advocate of the latter, and as soon
as the end of football made Saturdays free again,
he announced his intention of undertaking them
as often as the weather permitted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were not many sites
around Hillsgrove which combined the ideal qualifications
for a camp&#8211;good drainage, wood, and
water. The latter was particularly scarce. There
were one or two brooks&#8211;small, miserable affairs
with only a foot or two of depth, and a muddy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
half-stagnant mill-pond or so; but the single body
of water which would have been perfect for the
purpose was definitely and permanently barred to
them.</p>

<p>It was a small lake, half a mile long and varying
from two to four hundred feet in width, that
lay some four miles out of town. There was a
good bottom, depth in plenty even for diving, and
the banks on one side, at least, sloped back
sharply and were covered with a fine growth of
pine and hemlock, interspersed with white birch
and a good deal of hard wood. The boys had
often looked on it with longing eyes, but the owner
was a sour-faced, crotchety old man who was enraged
by the mere sight of a boy on his property.
He had placarded his woods with warning signs,
kept several dogs, and was even reputed to have
a gun loaded with bird-shot ready for instant
use on youthful trespassers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the latter was a slight exaggeration;
certainly no one had ever been actually peppered
with it. But the fact remained that old Caleb
Grimstone, who lived alone and had a well-established
reputation for crankiness, had stubbornly
refused all requests to be allowed to camp or picnic
on his property even when pay was offered,
and at length all such effort had been abandoned.
As Court Parker remarked, no doubt with a vivid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
recollection of sundry narrow escapes: &#8220;You
can steal a swim on the old codger if you keep a
weather-eye peeled and don&#8217;t mind doing a Marathon
through the brush; but when it comes to
anything like pitching a tent and settling down&#8211;<i>good</i>
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it may be imagined
that the announcement made one morning to the
group gathered about the school entrance that old
Grimstone had fallen through the hay-shoot and
broken an arm did not elicit any marked expressions
of regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serves him right, the old skinflint, after the
mean way he&#8217;s kept us away from the lake!&#8221;
growled Bob Gibson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; sniffed Harry Vedder. &#8220;He&#8217;s
a regular dog in the manger. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt
him to let us swim there in the summer, or camp
once in a while. He doesn&#8217;t use it himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use it!&#8221; exclaimed Frank Sanson. &#8220;Why,
they don&#8217;t even cut ice off it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just downright mean, that&#8217;s all!&#8221; put in
Rex Slater. &#8220;Say, fellows, what a chance this
would be to get ahead of the old chap and camp
out Friday or Saturday&#8211;if Mr. Curtis would only
let us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Sherman Ward, decidedly.
&#8220;Besides, it&#8217;s a lot too cold and looks like snow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
How did he manage, Ted? Living alone with
only those dogs, it must have been some stunt to
get word to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He got out to the road and waited for the first
team that came along,&#8221; explained Ted. &#8220;The
people took him into the house, and then sent Dr.
Maxwell out from town. He wanted somebody
to come and look after him, but old Grimey
wouldn&#8217;t hear of it. Said he couldn&#8217;t stand the
expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old miser! How does he manage to get
his meals and look after the stock?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eats bread and milk and canned stuff, I guess.
Bud Hinckley comes in night and morning, I understand,
to look after the horse and cow and
wash dishes and all that, but you know what
Bud is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So lazy he&#8217;d like somebody else to draw his
breath for him!&#8221; said Court Parker, promptly.
&#8220;Whew! What a lovely time the old man must
be having&#8211;and to-morrow Thanksgiving!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they trooped into school, the last words lingered
in Dale Tompkins&#8217;s mind. To-morrow
would, indeed, be Thanksgiving&#8211;the day of turkey,
and mince-pie, and good cheer generally. He
had no more cause than the others for sympathizing
with Caleb Grimstone, but somehow the mental
picture of the soured old man sitting alone in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
slovenly kitchen, one arm in a sling, and eating
bread and milk, with perhaps a can of lukewarm
tomatoes or corn, when every one else was feasting
merrily in company, made him vaguely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>He forgot it, however, in the excitement of a
brisk game of land-hockey up at Sherman&#8217;s that
afternoon, but after supper the picture returned
with renewed vividness, and with it something the
scoutmaster had said when he passed his second-class
examinations a few days ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never forget the daily good turn, Dale, or let
it slump into a perfunctory sort of thing such as
you would have to do anyway whether you were
a scout or not. A fellow can&#8217;t always find big
things, of course; but when the opportunity comes,
he isn&#8217;t a true scout if he cannot sacrifice his own
comfort or pleasure or inclination to bring help or
happiness to some one who really needs it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale squirmed a little at the recollection and
tried to go on with the book he was reading. But
the tale had lost its savor, and presently he raised
his eyes from the printed page and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody else thought anything about it!&#8221; he
muttered rebelliously. &#8220;Besides, to-morrow&#8217;s
Thanksgiving; that&#8217;s different from any other
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later he put away the book, said good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
night, and went up to his room. Having closed
the door, he opened his closet and took out his
scout suit. It had come only the day before; already
he had looked at it more than twenty times,
but the novelty had not yet worn off. He wondered
if fellows who had theirs merely for the
asking felt half as proud of it as he, who had
worked for every penny of its cost. He passed
one hand caressingly over the smooth olive khaki,
and then an odd thought popped suddenly into his
head.</p>

<p>He had tried it on, twice, but as yet he had not
actually worn it. Mightn&#8217;t it mean even more to
him if he wore it first in the performance of a
good turn that really counted?</p>

<p>Though the boy felt it only vaguely, and formulated
it not at all even in his mind, it was
something of that spirit of consecration that of
old dominated the young candidates for knighthood,
guarding their armor through the long
night-watches. Dale&#8217;s face took on an expression
of determination, and as he put away his things
his mind was oddly lightened.</p>

<p>Next morning he sallied forth, a trifle self-conscious
in all the glory of his new khaki, but
warmed by the look in his mother&#8217;s eyes as she
waved good-by from the door-step. Taking the
shortest cut, he proceeded to the rectory, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
Mr. Schofield appeared he saluted punctiliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have one of the baskets, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The rector smiled. &#8220;Ah! You&#8217;re going to
take it to&#8211;&#8221; He paused questioningly an instant;
then his smile deepened. &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he
said cordially. &#8220;They&#8217;re over in the parish-house.
The ladies are packing them now. Tell
Mrs. Mason I said you were to have a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Dale was making his way
briskly toward the Beldon Turnpike, a large market-basket
on one arm. The legs of a plump fowl
protruded from the covering; there were vegetables
within, a can of soup, celery, oranges,
bananas, and a small pie. The weight was not a
light one, but Dale whistled cheerfully as he strode
along.</p>

<p>He reached the turnpike without meeting any
of the fellows, and after ten or fifteen minutes&#8217;
tramping along the straight, level road he paused
to shift the basket to the other arm. It was heavier
than he thought. Overhead the gray sky was
a bit dispiriting, and the sharp, chill wind, blowing
across the open fields, made him glad he had
buttoned his sweater beneath the khaki coat.</p>

<p>Presently he began to speculate on what sort of
reception he would have, and for the first time
the possibility occurred to him that his welcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
might not be altogether cordial. You never could
tell what point of view the cranky old man would
take. He thought of the dogs, too, especially after
he had left the main road and turned into the
less frequented one leading past Grimstone&#8217;s
place. More than once people had been chased
by them, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly pleasant to picture
them rushing out at him in a body the moment
he set foot in the lane.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it did not occur to him to turn
back. He had set out with a definite purpose, and
he meant to carry it through. To be sure, just
before reaching the lane he cut himself a stout
stick, and as the old, weather-beaten frame house
came in sight he unconsciously made his approach
as noiseless as possible. He was surprised and
not a little relieved to see no signs of the animals,
but when he set down his basket and knocked
briskly on the back door, the snarling uproar that
instantly arose inside plainly advertised their
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Dale tightened his grip on the stick and strained
his ears for other sounds. He had raised his hand
for a second knock when the barking suddenly
lessened a little, and above the racket came a
growling admonition in Grimstone&#8217;s harsh tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, come in, can&#8217;t you? Are you deaf?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN ODD THANKSGIVING</span></h2>

<p>The note of ill temper in the voice was so
apparent that Dale hesitated for a second
longer. Then, with a determined movement of
his head, he set his stick against the door-casing,
picked up the basket, and stepped into the kitchen.
It was a long, low room, the walls and ceiling
painted a dirty gray. Two of the three windows
were tightly shuttered, so that Dale could barely
make out the bent figure seated in a rocking-chair
beside a rusty, decrepit cook-stove. At his entrance
the three dogs began to bark again, but old
Grimstone silenced them with a fierce gesture that
sent them cowering under a table.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217; you want?&#8221; he demanded, glaring at
the boy from under bushy brows. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to buy nothin&#8217;, so you&#8217;d better git out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything&#8211;for sale,&#8221; returned the
boy, finding it a little difficult to explain his errand.
&#8220;It&#8211;it&#8217;s your Thanksgiving dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner!&#8221; snapped the old man. &#8220;What are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
you talkin&#8217; about? I ain&#8217;t ordered nothin&#8217; from
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t. It&#8217;s one of the baskets
from the church. I&#8211;I heard you&#8217;d had an accident
and were all alone, so I&#8211;I thought I&#8217;d bring
it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the old man sat silent, his hard,
glinting eyes, full of sour suspicion, fixed on the
boy&#8217;s face. &#8220;What for?&#8221; he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; repeated Dale, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; what for? What d&#8217; you expect to git
out of it? You ain&#8217;t toted a basketful o&#8217; truck all
the way out here jest out of regard for me, I
reckon. Who sent ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale flushed, and unconsciously drew himself
up a little. &#8220;Nobody,&#8221; he returned briefly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a boy scout. We&#8211;we try to do a good turn
for somebody every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Grimstone bent slightly forward, staring in
a puzzled fashion at the trim, khaki-clad figure
before him. His right arm, bulky with bandages
and splints, was strapped tightly to his body; the
other hand, gnarled and brown, with blue veins
showing here and there, gripped the arm of the
rocker. There was suspicion still in his glance,
but back of it was the look of one groping dimly
for something he could not understand. Suddenly
he straightened with a jerk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;Wal, set it down somewheres, then!&#8221; he
growled ungraciously. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t an object o&#8217;
charity yet, but if you&#8217;re bound to leave it, I
s&#8217;pose I can use it somehow. You&#8217;d better be
startin&#8217; back right away or you&#8217;ll miss your dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale placed the basket on a table and commenced
to remove the paper. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going
back yet,&#8221; he explained cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to stay and cook it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Then the old
man grunted inarticulately; it might have been
with surprise, or incredulity, or almost any other
emotion. Dale&#8217;s back was toward him, so he could
not tell, but since there was no actual prohibition,
he proceeded with the unpacking.</p>

<p>Somehow he was beginning to enter more into
the spirit of the thing, beginning to feel an interest,
almost an enjoyment, in doing it up thoroughly.
Having taken off coat and sweater, his
first act was to prepare the chicken for roasting.
When it was safely placed in the oven he shook
down the fire, added some more wood, and then
turned his attention to a pile of unwashed dishes,
which the indolent Hinckley was evidently accumulating
until he considered it sizeable enough to
be worth tackling. It was a task the boy ordinarily
hated, but he meant to leave the room spick
and span on his departure. So he rolled up his
shirt-sleeves and plunged in, whistling softly as he
worked.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/illus3.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;What d&#8217;you want?&#8221; he demanded
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>Old Caleb Grimstone followed the boy&#8217;s movements
almost in silence. He had gruffly told him
where he could find a pan for the chicken, and
once he snapped out at one of the dogs who had
come forth from under the table and was sniffing
at Dale&#8217;s legs. But for the most part he sat motionless
beside the stove, his eyes, under their
beetling brows, fixed intently on the busy figure
with that same puzzled questioning in their
depths.</p>

<p>At last, when Dale had pared the potatoes and
put them on to boil, he suddenly growled, &#8220;Are
you one of them boys that come sneakin&#8217; around
the lake last summer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale reddened a little, but did not hesitate. &#8220;I
was out here two or three times, I guess,&#8221; he
acknowledged.</p>

<p>The old man sniffed. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you call <i>that</i>
one o&#8217; them &#8216;good turns&#8217;&#8211;trespassin&#8217; on a person&#8217;s
property, an&#8217; payin&#8217; no attention to signs,
an&#8217; all,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t a scout then,&#8221; said Dale. He got a
broom from the corner, and on his way past the
old man&#8217;s chair he paused, his eyes twinkling a
bit. &#8220;Anyhow, on a roasting hot day you know a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
fellow&#8217;ll do &#8217;most anything to get a swim. I expect
you were that way yourself, Mr. Grimstone,
when you were a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the old man, disagreeably, but
he made no further comment.</p>

<p>Once or twice, as he swept, Dale glanced curiously
at the silent figure by the stove and wondered
what the old fellow was thinking about. His
eyes no longer followed the boy with sharp suspicion.
His head was bent a little, and he stared
blankly, unseeingly, at a knot in the board at his
feet. For a long time he did not stir, save once
to lift the thin, veined hand from the chair-arm,
only to grip it again with a force that made the
knuckles stand out white against the brown skin.
At length, with a sigh, checked almost in its birth,
he raised his head and frowned at Tompkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to baste that fowl at all?&#8221; he
inquired sharply.</p>

<p>Dale started guiltily at the reminder and
hastened to the oven. The fowl was browning
nicely, and as he spooned up the sizzling juices,
he hoped his forgetfulness wasn&#8217;t going to make
any difference in its flavor.</p>

<p>Apparently it hadn&#8217;t. After a number of anxious
inspections, between which he set the table
for two, put plates to heat, and arranged the remaining
contents of the basket as temptingly as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
he could, he decided that the chicken was done,
and Mr. Grimstone, peering doubtfully into the
oven and even testing the fowl with a fork, grudgingly
agreed. When the old man was served and
his portion cut up so that he could manage it with
a fork, Dale took his first taste with a little feeling
of pride in his culinary achievement.</p>

<p>It was really a very appetizing meal, and the
scout enjoyed it as only a healthy, hungry boy can.
Mr. Grimstone made no comment one way or another.
Once or twice he mumbled his annoyance
at having to have his meat cut up for him by a
boy, but the number of times that the process
was repeated and the relish with which he consumed
everything in sight was proof enough of his
satisfaction in the unwonted fare.</p>

<p>As the curious meal proceeded to its conclusion
he seemed almost to thaw a little. His manner
was still crabbed and his voice sharp. He scowled
a good deal, too, especially after some comment
which might possibly be taken as approaching the
amiable. But in one way or another, both at table
and later while the dishes were being done up, he
asked a good many questions in his short, snappy
fashion.</p>

<p>Dale answered them readily, vaguely sensing,
perhaps, that under the old man&#8217;s surface crustiness
lay a certain awkwardness at handling so unaccustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
a situation. After all these years of
bitter warfare against boys it must be rather embarrassing,
he thought, to treat one of them with
even an approach to civility. So when he had
told his name, and the troop he belonged to, and
one or two other details the old man asked about,
Dale went on to explain a little about their scout
work and play, their weekly meetings and drill
and other duties, their hikes and week-end camping-trips.</p>

<p>The old man listened almost without comment.
He seemed more curious about the principle of
the daily good turn, to which he reverted several
times, always with expressions of doubt and
skepticism. The idea of mere boys giving time
and labor and sacrificing inclination and pleasure
without thought of reward was incredible to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t natural!&#8221; he declared at last.
&#8220;Mebbe one or two might, but not many. You
can&#8217;t tell me any other o&#8217; them young limbs in
town would of give up their holiday to tote a basket
o&#8217; truck out here an&#8217; cook it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they would!&#8221; protested the boy,
loyally, &#8220;if they&#8217;d thought of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted the old man. &#8220;They
didn&#8217;t happen to, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One was enough, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; smiled the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have known what to do with two
baskets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man snorted doubtfully and did not
pursue the subject farther. A little later, Dale
discovered, to his surprise, that it was after four.
He had no idea the time had flown so. He would
have to hustle to get back to town before dark.
Fortunately, the kitchen was cleared up, so after
stoking the fire he got into his sweater and coat.
Then he picked up the wide-brimmed felt hat and
carefully rearranged the depressions in its crown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Mr. Grimstone,&#8221; he said, glancing
over to where the latter had resumed his place by
the stove. &#8220;I hope your arm won&#8217;t be long coming
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man frowned at him from under the
bushy brows. His head was a little bent, and the
long, bony fingers curved over the chair-arm. It
was precisely the attitude with which he had
greeted the boy&#8217;s arrival; yet the latter was conscious
of a subtle, intangible difference, felt
rather than perceived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he answered curtly. That was all
until Dale reached the door and was turning the
knob. Then, &#8220;Much obleeged,&#8221; came jerkily from
the thin, straight lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be,&#8221; smiled the scout. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;ve
had a very good time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>It was not exactly the polite fiction that perhaps
it seemed. That was the odd part of it. As
he went briskly down the lane the boy realized
with surprise that not once had he thought regretfully
of the rare turkey-dinner at home, or the
fun with the fellows he had missed that afternoon.
One of the dogs, still licking his chops
from the dish of scraps that Dale had given them
in the shed, trotted after him, and the boy bent to
pat his head without a touch of nervousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bark&#8217;s a lot worse than your bite, old
fellow,&#8221; he said aloud.</p>

<p>He straightened up and glanced back at the
rambling, weather-beaten house, whose roof lines
seemed to merge into the cold gray of the sky, and
something deeper than pity stirred him at the
thought of the old man sitting alone there in the
twilight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he was a good deal like
his dogs,&#8221; he murmured as he turned away.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sort of glad&#8211;I found it out.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was quite dark before Dale reached home.
The return trip had been much harder to make
than the one that morning. The holiday was over
and there was no spirit of adventure to buoy him
up, no consciousness that he was going to be of
use to some one who needed him. Also, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
was plenty of time to think of the good cheer he
had missed at home&#8211;that family feast to which,
as long as he could remember, they had sat down
at three o&#8217;clock on Thanksgiving afternoon. It
had become so fixed and seemingly immovable
that Dale had not even considered the possibility
of changing it. And so it was with a tired and
lagging step that he walked up from the gate and
opened the front door.</p>

<p>Inside, he paused suddenly and sniffed. For an
instant he stood stock-still, eyes wide, mouth half
open. Then, with a sudden, incoherent exclamation,
he tore down the hall, past the lighted dining-room,
and through the open kitchen door.
The room was warm and bright, and filled with
the delicious odor of roasting turkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; he cried, his face shining. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t have it&#8211; You&#8211;you&#8211;waited!&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother straightened from closing the oven
door and smiled at him&#8211;that wonderful, indescribable
smile that somehow belongs to mothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I waited!&#8221; she said quietly. Then,
as he leaped forward and clutched her in a bear-hug,
she laughed softly and asked, just a little
tremulously, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you think Father and I
could do a good turn, too?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>There was no school on the Friday after
Thanksgiving, and as soon as Dale had finished
his chores he sallied forth to hunt up some
of the fellows. A light snow had fallen during the
night, but the day was clear and bright and just
the sort for a good active game or a brisk hike.
As he skirted the north side of the green a shrill
yodeling from behind brought the scout around to
see Court Parker bearing down upon him, calling
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, where were you yesterday, anyhow? I
didn&#8217;t see you all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was&#8211;busy,&#8221; returned Dale, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Busy stuffing yourself, I s&#8217;pose. Well, you
missed a dandy game up at Sherm&#8217;s. We&#8217;re going
to have another this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the snow&#8211; Say! Why couldn&#8217;t we
play &#8216;Smugglers over the Border,&#8217; or something
like that? It&#8217;s just the day for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Court&#8217;s glance swept comprehensively over the
snow-covered green and his eyes brightened. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
hadn&#8217;t thought of that. Now and then you do
manage to hit the little black circle, Tommy.
Let&#8217;s hunt up the bunch and see what they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd was presently gathered from several
different parts of town, and the majority approved
of Dale&#8217;s suggestion. Ranny Phelps and
several of his clique had other plans for the afternoon,
but Ranny had a habit of frequently failing
to take part in the troop doings, unless these were
official and gave him a chance to appear in uniform,
girded with authority, so his absence was
not unexpected.</p>

<p>Immediately after lunch the others betook
themselves a mile outside of town, sides were
chosen, and the &#8220;border&#8221; laid out. This consisted
of about four hundred yards of a little-used
road where the snow had not been much disturbed.
This was patrolled by a portion of the &#8220;custom
inspectors,&#8221; with a reserve posted farther inland.
About half a mile back from the road a deserted
barn did duty for the &#8220;town.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smugglers gathered about half a mile on
the other side of the border and were allowed to
cross it in any formation, singly, together, or
scattered, and make for the town at any speed
they chose. One only of their number was supposed
to be smuggling, and he was equipped with
tracking-irons. The moment a sentry patrolling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
the border caught sight of these tracks, his duty
was to signal the fact to the reserve party of inspectors
and at once follow the track himself.
The reserves coöperated with him, trying by any
means to catch the smuggler before he could reach
the town. If they succeeded, the game was theirs;
but if the smuggler eluded them and reached the
barn safely, victory went to the other side.</p>

<p>It was a typical scout sport, and for three hours
or more the fellows played it strenuously, varying
it toward the end with one or two other stalking
games. These all met with unanimous approval,
even Bob Gibson, the habitual grumbler, admitting
that it was more fun than he thought it would
be.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to try some more of those in the
book,&#8221; Ward remarked as they tramped back
through the twilight. &#8220;That deer-hunt one
sounds pretty good, if you fellows will only make
bows and arrows enough. I vote we fix up a deer
and go to it next Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened, however, that the following Saturday
was devoted to something even more interesting
than deer-hunting. As Dale entered the
parish-house on Monday evening he passed Mr.
Curtis, just inside the door, talking earnestly with
Wesley Becker.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a big surprise to me, I can tell you,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
he heard the scoutmaster say. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine
what has brought about the transformation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t say, I suppose?&#8221; asked Becker.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s just the curt invitation. He&#8217;s
hedged it about with all sorts of prohibitions, but
still it&#8217;s wonderful he should have come around
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be corking for the troop!&#8221; exclaimed
Becker, enthusiastically. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one thing
we&#8217;ve lacked, and if&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that point Tompkins passed beyond the
range of their voices, but he had heard enough to
rouse his curiosity. Fortunately this did not have
to remain long unsatisfied. After the opening
exercises the scoutmaster faced the three patrols,
a small sheet of paper in one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Attention, scouts!&#8221; he said crisply. &#8220;The
troop will be much pleased to learn, I&#8217;m sure,
that Mr. Grimstone has given us permission to
use the north side of his lake for camping purposes.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant there was amazed silence. Then
a bedlam of surprised comment arose, mingled
with a torrent of eager questions, which Mr. Curtis
did not attempt to quell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that!&#8221; &#8220;Hurrah
for old Grimey!&#8221; &#8220;Can we skate there, Mr.
Curtis?&#8221; &#8220;Will he let us swim in the summer?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
&#8220;Can&#8217;t we go out this Saturday?&#8221; &#8220;How did you
work it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One at a time,&#8221; smiled the scoutmaster. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
answer the last one first. I didn&#8217;t &#8216;work it,&#8217; as
you so pithily express it, Vedder, at all. I&#8217;ve
failed several times to get this privilege from Mr.
Grimstone, and his letter this morning was as
much of a surprise to me as to any one. He
doesn&#8217;t state the reason for his change of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shock of sharp surprise sent the blood tingling
into Dale Tompkins&#8217;s face and clenched his
hands spasmodically. &#8220;Gee!&#8221; he muttered under
his breath. &#8220;I wonder&#8211; Why, it must be!
But I never thought of that&#8211;not for a minute!&#8221;
He paused an instant, his gaze growing introspective.
&#8220;He certainly is one good old scout,&#8221; he
murmured to himself. &#8220;I said his bark was a lot
worse than his bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he realized that Mr. Curtis was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not to go beyond the dam at one end
of the lake or the inlet at the other. In other
words, there must be no trespassing on the side
of the water where the buildings and orchard
stand. He doesn&#8217;t wish any timber cut, and there
are several other minor prohibitions. He says
nothing against swimming or skating, so I imagine
both will be allowed. As for camping there on
Saturday, I&#8217;m afraid it will be too cold to stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
overnight, but there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t
hike out in the morning and make a day of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was that the following Saturday morning
found practically the entire troop hiking briskly
along the Beldon Turnpike at an early hour.
Ranny Phelps had complained that there wouldn&#8217;t
be much fun in just a picnic affair, but he was
there, nevertheless. The others had no such criticism
to make. They fairly bubbled enthusiasm,
and in their eagerness to reach the hitherto forbidden
spot many of them would have willingly
gone the entire distance at scout&#8217;s pace.</p>

<p>When they finally left the road and turned off
into the woods along an overgrown lumber-track,
it was like exploring an undiscovered country.
Most of them had been there before, but with a
difference. When one&#8217;s ears must be constantly
open for the baying of dogs, with the necessity
ever present of being ready for instant flight,
there is little chance to appreciate the beauties of
nature. Now, instead of having to creep along
through trees and undergrowth, they could boldly
follow the shore-line, investigate every little cove
or promontory, discuss possible camping-sites,
and even make definite plans with the assurance
that these could be actually carried out in the
spring.</p>

<p>At about eleven o&#8217;clock they reached the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
swimming-place near the head of the lake and
halted by general consent. Hitherto, they had
considered the spot solely from the point of view
of aquatic sport; now they realized that a more
ideal spot for a camp could scarcely be imagined.
A small, rocky point thrust its flat nose out into
the lake. One side was sliced off as with a knife,
and here the depth varied from six to eight feet;
on the other it shelved more gradually. Back of
it, the level open space, facing south and hedged
in by a thick shelter of hemlock, would accommodate
five or six shelter-tents with ease. Scarcely
a dozen yards away, a clear spring bubbled into
a mossy basin.</p>

<p>In an instant packs were laid aside, and under
Becker&#8217;s direction one party foraged for wood
while another brought stones for an oven and cut
saplings for the crane or forked sticks to use in
broiling meat. Sandwiches and other ready-to-eat
provisions were not looked upon with favor.
Every boy wanted something he could cook, and
the variety of chops, small steaks, eggs, bacon,
ham, and the like that swiftly appeared was endless.
One enterprising scout had even brought a
can of twist-dough and proceeded deftly to brown
it on sticks held over the embers. On every hand
were voiced regrets that they couldn&#8217;t have come
prepared to stay overnight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it would have been too cold,
with the fire and everything,&#8221; said Bennie Rhead,
after they had finished luncheon and were sitting
lazily around the blaze for a bit before tackling
the job of cleaning up. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s as warm as
toast now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally, with the sun pouring in here all
the morning,&#8221; smiled Mr. Curtis. &#8220;You&#8217;d find
it rather different at night. If we all had sleeping-bags
or tents that were really tight, we might
undertake it. But our sort of equipment isn&#8217;t
meant for winter, and there&#8217;s no use risking
colds when you&#8217;ll have all the time you want
next spring and summer. By the way, Sherman,
did you send that letter to Mr. Grimstone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Ted and Ranny and I made it up,
and all the fellows signed it. I posted it on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I wrote him, myself, but I
wanted him to see that you fellows, as well, appreciated
what he&#8217;s done.&#8221; He rested his head
against a tree-trunk and glanced appraisingly
around the glade. &#8220;What a place this would be
for a log-cabin!&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Immense!&#8221; exclaimed Court Parker, sitting
suddenly upright. &#8220;With a big stone fireplace at
one end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And bunks!&#8221; added Sanson, enthusiastically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
&#8220;And shelves where we could keep pans and things.
And&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could camp here any time of the year then,
couldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! And think of coming in when your
hands and feet are &#8217;most frozen from skating, and
thawing out before a roaring blaze, and making
some cocoa,&#8211;oh, yum! Do you s&#8217;pose there&#8217;s
any chance, Mr. Curtis, of his letting us&#8211;&#8221; Sherman
broke off with a sigh. &#8220;I forgot. He
doesn&#8217;t want any timber cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and I&#8217;d scarcely like to ask him, anyway,
after he&#8217;s been so decent,&#8221; said the scoutmaster.
&#8220;It would look as if we didn&#8217;t appreciate what
he&#8217;s done already.&#8221; His glance swept thoughtfully
around the open space again as if he were
seeing in his mind&#8217;s eye the structure that had excited
such instant enthusiasm. &#8220;Of course, it
would be quite possible to cut enough timber for a
cabin without in the least hurting the woods; in
fact a little thinning would do them good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be a corking place to feed the
birds from in winter!&#8221; suddenly spoke up Paul
Trexler, a silent, reserved sort of chap. &#8220;We
started up three or four covies of quail between
the road and here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly would!&#8221; The scoutmaster&#8217;s tone
was emphatic. &#8220;You&#8217;ve hit the best argument in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
its favor yet, Paul. The woods are fairly teeming
with birds of all sorts; I noticed it as we came
along. The place has been barred to the public
for so long that I dare say the wild creatures have
come to feel more or less safe here. With a cabin
right on this spot we could keep grain in fairly
large quantities, and when the heavy snows come,
it would be easy to establish regular feeding-stations
at different points, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden yelping made him break off and turn
quickly, to see a large dog burst from the thicket
at one side of the glade. With hair bristling and
teeth bared, the animal pulled up abruptly and
started a furious barking.</p>

<p>The scouts leaped up and several snatched
sticks from the woodpile. An instant later, however,
the low, sweeping hemlock branches parted,
and Caleb Grimstone himself stepped into the
open. With a snarl he silenced the dog and sent
him groveling to heel. Then he faced Mr. Curtis
and the boys with an odd, embarrassed defiance
that made the former suspect his appearance had
not been intentional, but was rather the result of
the dog&#8217;s outburst.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is mighty nice, Mr. Grimstone!&#8221; exclaimed
the scoutmaster, advancing with outstretched
hand. &#8220;You see we haven&#8217;t lost any
time in taking advantage of your kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; mumbled the old man. &#8220;I was jest
takin&#8217; a little walk, an&#8217; heard voices&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused awkwardly, glowering around the
circle of wide-eyed boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea you were able to walk so far,&#8221;
put in Mr. Curtis, quickly, &#8220;or we&#8217;d certainly
have invited you to eat lunch with us. Won&#8217;t you
let the boys cook you something now? They&#8217;re
mighty proud of the way they can&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had dinner,&#8221; interrupted the old man,
hastily. He fumbled for a moment with the stout
cane he carried; then his gaze returned to the
scoutmaster. &#8220;I heard you sayin&#8217; somethin&#8217;
about feedin&#8217; birds,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know you&#8211; What was it you meant?&#8221;</p>

<p>Briefly Mr. Curtis explained their methods of
establishing feeding-stations through the woods
and caring for them. When he had finished, Mr.
Grimstone nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; he commented grumpily, &#8220;I&#8211;I like
the birds. One o&#8217; the reasons I wouldn&#8217;t&#8211;&#8221; He
paused again and glowered at the boys. &#8220;<i>They</i>
couldn&#8217;t make a log-cabin,&#8221; he stated positively.
&#8220;It would be too much like real work.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden stir went through the group. Mr.
Curtis smiled. &#8220;I should hate to set them at it
unless I really wanted it done,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d they know what trees to cut an&#8217; what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
to leave? They&#8217;d make a mess o&#8217; the whole
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with proper supervision,&#8221; argued Mr.
Curtis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you look after it?&#8221; inquired the old
man, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! I&#8217;d gladly constitute myself general
foreman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; There was a momentary pause,
tense with suspense. A battery of eyes, eager,
expectant, pleading, was turned upon the old man,
whose bent shoulders straightened a bit. &#8220;Wal,
you can go ahead, then,&#8221; he agreed crustily.
&#8220;But all I can say is&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A quick exclamation from the scouts drowned
the remainder of his words. &#8220;G&#8211;e&#8211;e!&#8221; came
hissing from a score of lips in a long sigh of rapture.
It was followed by a bedlam of excited
chatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The greatest thing I ever heard!&#8221; exploded
Ted MacIlvaine, enthusiastically. &#8220;A log-cabin,
fellows&#8211;think of it! A troop cabin!&#8221; With
eyes shining, he stepped suddenly forward and
faced the crowd. &#8220;Three cheers for Mr. Grimstone,
fellows!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;and make &#8217;em good
ones!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the last echo had died away, a faint touch
of pink tinged the old man&#8217;s leathery brown skin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
But his frown abated nothing of its fierceness as
he turned to the scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut-tut&#8211;nonsense!&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave
it to you, then; you&#8217;ll be responsible, mind! I
s&#8217;pose you know what trees to take out&#8211;or you
ought to. Nothin&#8217; over eight inches, remember,
an&#8217; not a scrap o&#8217; rubbish left lyin&#8217; around when
you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned abruptly
and stalked off, a lean, bent, shabby figure with
a nose like an eagle&#8217;s beak and fiercely beetling
brows. To the boys staring after him he was an
angel in disguise.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>ELKHORN CABIN</span></h2>

<p>All that week the members of Troop Five
could talk or think of little else save the
wonderful log-cabin which was to arise like magic
on the shore of Crystal Lake. That, at least, was
the way many of them pictured it as going up, but
at the meeting on Monday night Mr. Curtis gave
a little talk in which he pointed out that the undertaking
could only be carried through by a good
deal of hard, persistent labor, which would undoubtedly
grow more or less tiresome before the
end was reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saturday is really the only day when we can
all get together,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there won&#8217;t be
many of them before the snow comes to put a
stop to things. If we mean to enjoy it this winter,
we&#8217;ve got to give every spare minute of our
time to the work. There can&#8217;t be any slowing
down or backing out. Now, if you&#8217;d rather wait
till spring, when we can take things more
easily&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>sir</i>!&#8221; came in a swift, united chorus of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
protest. &#8220;We want to start now. We want to
have it this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster smiled a little. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
way I feel myself,&#8221; he said; &#8220;so we&#8217;ll consider
that part settled. We&#8217;ll meet here, then, next
Saturday morning at half past eight, prepared to
put in a strenuous day. I&#8217;ll tell the different
patrol-leaders what tools are needed, and they
can look them up during the week. There&#8217;s another
thing. We&#8217;ll have to buy considerable material,
such as cement, boards for the floor and
roof, window- and door-casings, and the like.
That money should be earned by the troop, and I
think it would be a good plan for Ward, MacIlvaine,
and Phelps to meet at my house to-morrow
afternoon or evening to discuss ways and means.
Is that agreeable?&#8221;</p>

<p>It proved to be, when the question was put to
vote and decided unanimously in the affirmative.
The meeting ended with the enthusiasm over the
project unchecked by this placing of it on a strictly
methodical and businesslike basis.</p>

<p>That enthusiasm continued throughout the week,
and when the crowd assembled on Saturday, Bennie
Rhead, who was housed by a bad cold, was the
only absentee. The others, laden with axes, saws,
hatchets, an adz or two and some wide wood-chisels
until they resembled a gang of pioneers, were in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
high spirits and eager to begin work. Their interest
was heightened by the production of a plan
Mr. Curtis had drawn up, showing a cabin twenty
by sixteen feet, with a big stone fireplace opposite
the door, two windows, and a double tier of
bunks, one on each side of the entrance.</p>

<p>During the week the scoutmaster had gone over
the ground with Mr. Grimstone and marked certain
trees which were to be taken out, mainly
white pines from six to eight inches in diameter
that were too closely crowded to develop properly,
so there was no delay in starting work. Immediately
on reaching the point, the entire troop
was divided into groups of three or four, each under
the leadership of a boy who knew how to
handle an ax. As soon as he felled a tree the others
trimmed off the scanty limbs, sawed it into
proper lengths, and stacked these up in piles on
either side of the glade.</p>

<p>By noon the piles had assumed such proportions
that after luncheon half of the wood-cutters
were called off and set to notching the ends
of the log, about eight inches from the end, and
this was work in which everybody could take
part. The notches were made on opposite sides
of the log, about eight inches from the end, and
were a quarter the thickness of the timber in
depth. The logs averaged pretty much the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
diameter, so that, when fitted together at right
angles with the under notch on one side resting
in the upper notch on the other, the whole length
was snugly in contact, with scarcely any chinks
to be filled in.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the great advantage of pine,&#8221; said Mr.
Curtis, when he had explained the method to the
boys. &#8220;Almost any hard wood will have bumps
and twists in it, but the trunks of pines growing
as thickly as these are practically straight from
one end to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going to build up the four walls solid,
and then cut holes for the door and windows and
fireplace?&#8221; asked Paul Trexler, who had evidently
been reading up on the construction of cabins.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
way many of them are made, but I could never
quite see its advantage. It&#8217;s a mean job, sawing
the openings, and the full-length logs are lots
harder to handle than shorter ones, to say nothing
of the waste of timber. Of course there&#8217;ll
have to be full-length ones under and over the windows
and over the door; but if we measure accurately,
there&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t leave
these openings as we go along, and so save time
and labor. Spiking the door- and window-casings
to the logs will hold them together firmly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cabin had already been staked out, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
when, presently, the lower logs were set in place
it was amazing what a difference the sight of that
simple rectangle made. Instantly the visualizing
of their dream became nearer and more concrete
to the boys, its possibilities more apparent. They
could see at a glance its size and shape and spaciousness.
Entering through the door space, one
could say that here would be the bunks, there the
windows, and that gap opposite, the fireplace. It
stimulated every one to renewed efforts. Blisters
and tired muscles were forgotten in the eager desire
to get another tier of logs into position.
When Mr. Grimstone stalked into view, toward
the middle of the afternoon, he was greeted by
urgent invitations to &#8220;Come ahead and see how
the cabin&#8217;s going up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man responded stiffly, but it was impossible
to maintain that attitude long in the face
of the boisterous, whole-hearted enthusiasm of
twenty boys. Inside of ten minutes he was chuckling
over the awkward efforts of one scout to
handle an adz and showing him the proper
method. Within an hour, one would never have
known him for the crusty, crabbed recluse who
had been at odds with the Hillsgrove boys for
more than a generation. He had shown the scouts
a splendid place to get rocks for the fireplace, and
told them how to make, with two poles and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
cross saplings, a sort of litter for carrying the
larger ones; he had made the rounds of the wood-choppers
and watched them interestedly, criticizing,
suggesting, and even cracking a dry joke or
two at their expense. But his interest seemed to
center in the building operations, to which he
finally returned. When Mr. Curtis followed him
a little later, he paused at the edge of the glade,
a quiet smile curving his lips.</p>

<p>The old man stood amid a group of boys who
were notching the logs. He had evidently been
showing them some improvement on their methods,
for as the scoutmaster stood there, he heard
one of them say: &#8220;Is that right, Mr. Grimstone?
Is that the way you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, son;
you&#8217;ll find that&#8217;ll save you a lot of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Grimstone,&#8221; piped up Harry Vedder,
from the other side of the cabin, &#8220;won&#8217;t you come
over here, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wait a minute, Dumpling!&#8221; admonished
Bob Gibson. &#8220;I&#8217;m next. He promised to give
me some points about fitting &#8217;em together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster&#8217;s smile deepened as he came
forward. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to appoint you building
foreman, Mr. Grimstone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Looks
as if you knew a lot more about log-cabins than
I ever will.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>From force of habit the other frowned, but his
eyes were twinkling. &#8220;I&#8217;d orter, I reckon,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;I built enough of &#8217;em when I was loggin&#8217;
up state. If it wan&#8217;t for this pesky arm&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That needn&#8217;t interfere. You won&#8217;t have to
lift a finger. The boys are only too ready to work
when they know how. Seriously, if you could
oversee the building part, it would help us a lot.
Then I could give all my time to getting out the
logs, cleaning up, and looking after the chimney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I can,&#8221; observed the old man, briefly.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t fit for much else jest now&#8211;an&#8217; the sooner
you&#8217;re done, the sooner the mess&#8217;ll be cleared
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and the following Saturday
found Mr. Grimstone promptly on the job. There
was no question of his pleasure in the work, in
spite of the occasional grumblings to which he gave
vent in odd moments when he was not entirely lost
in the novel occupation. To these the boys paid
scant attention. They seemed to realize that they
were merely superficial and really meant nothing,
and from the first they got on admirably with the
old man. They even joshed and joked with him,
and before long he was retorting with sundry dry
comments that sent them off into shouts of laughter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>Under his supervision the cabin grew apace.
When the logs were all cut and carried in, Mr.
Curtis devoted himself mainly to the stone chimney
which, though necessarily slower and more
difficult work, progressed very well. The opening
was made to take four-foot logs, and the stone
facing filled up more than half that end of the
cabin. The boys could not wait for its completion
to give it a baptism of fire. When the sides were
up three feet or more, they kindled a blaze and
cooked lunch there&#8211;the first meal to be prepared
in the cabin.</p>

<p>Another celebration marked the setting of the
ridge-pole; and when the roof was laid, it seemed
as if the end was actually in sight. In the meantime,
the important detail of earning money to
pay for necessary materials had not been lost
sight of. It had been decided that the scouts
should go about this either singly or in groups,
as they preferred. A number of suggestions
were made by Mr. Curtis, but it was impressed
upon the troop that there must be no appeal for
either work or money in any way that would in
the least savor of begging. Whatever they did
must be real work, the sort that people wanted
done whether or not a scout cabin was in process
of erection; and they must always give value received.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>The methods resorted to seemed endless. Three
boys who were adept with saw, hammer, and
plane undertook the building of bird-houses, and
their products were so well made and attractive
that they had a hard time filling orders. Others
raked up lawns, tended furnaces, cleaned cellars,
sawed wood, and did a score of other varied
chores. One entire patrol took up the subscription
proposition of a big publishing-house and devoted
themselves to it with such ardor that they
cleared up nearly as much as all the rest together.</p>

<p>It can safely be said that few members of the
troop had many spare minutes in the month that
followed the starting of the cabin. There was
no time for sports or games or reading stories.
The public library was deserted. Of course there
were a few who tired of the constant pressure
and managed to escape a Saturday&#8217;s labor by some
flimsy pretext, but, on the whole, they stuck to it
with remarkable perseverance. And when the
last stone was in place on the chimney-top, the last
chink filled, the last nail driven, there wasn&#8217;t a
boy in all that twenty-five who didn&#8217;t feel a thrill
of proud achievement at the result of their united
efforts.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A CRY IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>

<p>Very seldom does reality come up to expectation,
but this was one of the rare exceptions.
It was the very cabin of their dreams that
rose, a concrete fact, before their admiring gaze.
As they stood off surveying the walls of neatly fitting
logs, the sloping roof where a covering of
split saplings concealed the useful, waterproof
tar-paper, the square, workmanlike chimney rising
beyond, there was a moment of almost awed silence,
broken presently by Court Parker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some cabin!&#8221; he exclaimed, voicing the feeling
of them all. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem as if we could
have built that ourselves, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did, though&#8211;we and Mr. Curtis and Mr.
Grimstone!&#8221; jubilated Ted MacIlvaine. &#8220;Gee!
Think of its being finished, and think of its being
ours! Come on inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went with a rush and broke into eager
loud-voiced admiration of their handiwork. They
tried the bunks, stout frameworks of pine with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
lengths of heavy canvas stretched tightly over
them, and pronounced them better than any mattress,
clamorously upheld the merit of one piece
of work over another, and discussed the need of
a table, chairs, and various other conveniences.
Of course a fire was started, and when the red
blaze roared up the chimney they rejoiced at the
perfection of the draught. Then began a strenuous
altercation as to what the cabin should be
called which bade fair to end in a deadlock, owing
to the wide variety of suggestions.</p>

<p>Neither the scoutmaster nor Mr. Grimstone
took part in this. The former believed in letting
the boys settle such questions unaided, while the
old man so unaffectedly enjoyed the boys&#8217; delight
that he simply sat in the background, silent, but
with twinkling eyes. When a lull came in the
dispute, however, he bethought himself of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a pair of elk horns down to the barn
you boys may as well have,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You
can hang &#8217;em up over the fireplace for an ornament.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elk horns!&#8221; exclaimed Dale Tompkins.
&#8220;They&#8217;d be dandy! Say!&#8221; he went on eagerly,
stirred by sudden inspiration, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter
with that for a name, fellows&#8211;Elkhorn Cabin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swell!&#8221; agreed two or three scouts at once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s better than any we&#8217;ve had. Sounds like
the real thing, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>A vote was promptly taken, and though Ranny
Phelps and a few others were against it, the majority
approved. The horns, a fine pair of antlers,
were fetched and hung in place, and the cabin
formally christened.</p>

<p>&#8220;And next week,&#8221; said Frank Sanson, as they
were packing up for their tramp home through
the crisp twilight, &#8220;we can come out to camp,
can&#8217;t we, Mr. Curtis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster nodded. &#8220;Provided the
weather is decent and you all get your parents&#8217;
consent, I don&#8217;t see any reason why we shouldn&#8217;t
spent Friday night here. It may be a bit crowded,
but we&#8217;ll manage some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact they did not have to. Indeed,
there came very near being no overnight
hike at all. During the building of the cabin the
weather had been singularly favorable. It was
snapping cold much of the time but save for a
flurry or two of snow, the days had been uniformly
clear. Now, however, as if to make up for
her smiles, Nature proceeded to frown. Wednesday
was overcast, and all day Thursday a cold
rain came down to damp the spirits of the would-be
campers. It turned to snow during the night,
and next morning found the country-side covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
with a mantle of white. The temperature was
well below freezing and dropping steadily, and
Mr. Curtis, who had practically given up the idea
of occupying the cabin that night, was surprised
toward the middle of the afternoon by the appearance
at his door of a group of white-flecked figures,
very rosy of cheek and bright of eye, carrying
blanket-rolls and hung about with cooking utensils
and sundry parcels.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go, can&#8217;t we, sir?&#8221; inquired Ted MacIlvaine,
eagerly, as he dusted the snow off his
coat. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to give it up, are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster&#8217;s eyebrows lifted. &#8220;Have you
all got permission?&#8221; he asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. We can go if you go,&#8221; came in a
prompt chorus.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Curtis hesitated. After all,
there couldn&#8217;t be any risk about the trip even if
the storm continued all night. The cabin was
weather-proof, and enough fire-wood had been cut
to last them a week. With plenty of food and good
blankets they would be as snug as possible, and he
knew from experience the charm of the woods
in a snow-storm. Looking the bunch over appraisingly,
he saw that there were only seven&#8211;MacIlvaine,
Parker, Dale Tompkins, Frank Sanson,
Bob Gibson, Turk Gardner and Pete Oliver,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
all self-reliant boys of the type who were willing
to stand a little roughing it without complaint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the only ones who want to go?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; returned MacIlvaine. &#8220;Sherman&#8217;s
away, and Wes has a cold. The others all
thought&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold feet!&#8221; stated Oliver, derisively, running
his fingers through a thatch of bright, red hair.
&#8220;They&#8217;re afraid they might get a chill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much danger of that when you&#8217;re around,
Pete,&#8221; laughed the scoutmaster. &#8220;Well, you boys
had better come in and wait. It&#8217;ll take me ten
or fifteen minutes to get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appeared in rather less than that time,
sweatered, mackinawed, with high, laced boots,
woolen cap, and heavy gloves. Over one shoulder
swung his blanket-roll, and strapped to his back
was a good-sized haversack of provisions. He
knew from experience that some one was sure to
have forgotten something, so he always went prepared
to supply deficiencies.</p>

<p>It was a joyous, hilarious bunch that made their
way through the town and out along the Beldon
Turnpike. Most of them had their staves, and
two had brought snow-shoes along. Their attempts
to use these unfamiliar articles occasioned
much amusement among the others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>It took the better part of two hours to reach the
cabin. The snow had drifted considerably, and
the road was scarcely broken through. After they
reached the woods the going was especially hard,
and a general shout of rejoicing went up as the
first sight of the sloping, snow-covered roof
loomed up through the twilight. When the door
was unlocked they entered with a rush, packs and
blanket-rolls were dropped, and a fire started at
once. When this was blazing merrily, Mr. Curtis
divided the boys into two squads, one of which undertook
preparations for supper and straightened
up the cabin generally, while the others scraped
a path through the snow down to the shore of
the lake.</p>

<p>There were minor mishaps, of course, in the
culinary department. A few chops were burned,
and the baked potatoes resembled lumps of charcoal
rather than things edible. But there was
plenty for all, and nothing had ever tasted so
good as the supper eaten there on the floor before
the dancing flames. Afterward, when things
were cleared away and the boys sprawled out on
their blankets before the fireplace, the two lanterns
were extinguished and only the red glow
of the fire illumined the half-circle of eager young
faces. The wailing of the wind in the pines and
the soft, whispering beat of snow against the windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
served only to intensify the cozy warmth
and cheer of the cabin. Instinctively the boys
drew closer together and, snuggling in their blankets,
discussed for a space the unbelievable stupidity
of any sane person preferring a humdrum evening
at home to this. Then some one besought Mr.
Curtis to tell a story.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a story?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a ghost story, of course!&#8221; urged several
voices at once.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis laughed, stretched out his legs comfortably,
thought for a minute or two, and then
in a slow, sepulchral voice began a narrative
which he called &#8220;The Headless Horseman of the
Harlem.&#8221; It was a tale full of creeps and thrills,
abounding in dank vaults, weird apparitions, wild
storms, midnight encounters, and various other
appropriate settings and incidents. The boys
drew closer still, luxuriating in the &#8220;spookiness&#8221;
of it all, and then, just as some of the more impressionable
were beginning to cast nervous
glances behind them, he ended with a ridiculous
climax that brought forth a shout of laughter
and turned the whole thing into a farce.</p>

<p>A &#8220;round-robin&#8221; followed, the scoutmaster
starting a yarn and leaving it at an exciting and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
dramatic moment for the boy on his right to continue.
The absurdity of these continuations kept
the crowd in a constant gale of merriment, and
when the round was made they clamored for another.
But it was growing late, so Mr. Curtis
substituted a brief anecdote of scout bravery which
had a humorous twist. It was the story, so often
repeated in scout annals, of a little fellow plunging
unhesitatingly to the rescue of a bigger boy
who had stumbled beyond his depth in a swimming-hole.
The stronger lad seized his rescuer about
the neck and forced his head below the water. The
youngster was unable to free himself, but with
head down and breath almost gone, he hit bottom,
and then, calmly walking along it, he tugged along
his struggling friend until the bank was reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;He simply kept his head, you see, and used his
brain, which is one of the best things scouting
teaches us,&#8221; concluded Mr. Curtis. He stood up,
stretching. &#8220;Blankets out, fellows,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;and everybody in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each bunk had been planned to accommodate
two occupants, so there was no crowding or
necessity for makeshifts. The fire was piled up
with fresh logs, and though there was a good deal
of preliminary laughter and chattering, the boys
were too tired to stay awake long, even under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
novel conditions. Bob Gibson was one of the
last to close his eyes. He had the outside of one
of the lower bunks with a full view of the fire, and
though few would have suspected his gruff, matter-of-fact
manner to overlay even a touch of poetry
or imagination, he lay there watching it for a long
time, fascinated by the leaping, dancing, crimson-yellow
flames, until sleep at length overtook him.</p>

<p>How long he lay oblivious to sights and sounds
he had no idea. But it must have been hours later
when he found himself sitting bolt upright, every
nerve tingling and in his ears the echo of that
strange, horrible cry that had shocked him into
complete wakefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; came in a tense, frightened
gasp from one of the boys across the room.</p>

<p>Bob did not answer. He sat there shaking nervously
and straining his ears for a repetition of
the ghastly sound. The fire had died down to a
bed of dull red embers, and there was a noticeable
chill over everything. He caught his breath as a
dark shadow swiftly passed him and then realized,
with a feeling of keen relief, that it was Mr. Curtis.
A moment later the scoutmaster had thrown an
armful of light wood on the embers and the fire
blazed up, illumining the pale faces of the boys,
strained, startled, but all tense with expectation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cry came again, a piercing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
strangled, high-pitched scream that turned the
blood cold and brought out beads of perspiration
on more than one forehead. It seemed to come
from just outside the cabin door.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHAT THEY FOUND</span></h2>

<p>By this time MacIlvaine and Frank Sanson
had tumbled out of their bunks, and Bob followed
their example.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&#8211;what is it, sir?&#8221; he asked, striving to
keep his voice steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Mr. Curtis, briefly.
He had slid into his riding-breeches and was hurriedly
dragging on the heavy boots. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what we&#8217;ll have to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob hastily caught up his trousers. &#8220;It&#8211;it
sounded like somebody being&#8211;choked,&#8221; he said
shakily.</p>

<p>Every one was out on the floor now, grabbing
hastily for his clothes. Oliver caused a momentary
spasm of mirth by trying to crowd both feet
into one trouser-leg, but for the most part the boys
huddled on their things in silence, shivering a bit
from cold and nervousness. In about two minutes
they were ready, and, catching up their staves,
they hurried out into the open, the scoutmaster
leading the way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>It had stopped snowing, and overhead a few
stars gleamed coldly out of the blue-black sky.
The wind had died down and the snow-clad woods
stretched away before them, dim, white, oppressively
silent, the tree-trunks black, the laden hemlocks
distorted into queer shapes and shadows.</p>

<p>The bright gleam from the scoutmaster&#8217;s flash-light,
sweeping the snow about the cabin door,
showed it unbroken by a single footprint of man
or animal. They pushed on through the group
of hemlocks, showering themselves with icy particles,
but still they neither saw nor heard anything
unusual. Then, just as some of the sounder
sleepers were beginning to wonder whether they
might not have dreamed it all, there rang out suddenly
from among the tall laurel-bushes to their
left a piercing, gurgling scream.</p>

<p>The horrible sound, so much clearer and more
blood-curdling in the open, seemed to paralyze
them all. For a fraction of a second they stood
motionless; then Mr. Curtis plunged forward
through the snow, and the rest followed in a straggling
group, eyes starting and hands spasmodically
clenching their staves.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somebody being&#8211;murdered!&#8221; gasped Bob
Gibson, huskily. &#8220;I knew the minute I heard it
that something awful&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off with a queer, inarticulate murmur.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
Mr. Curtis had stopped so suddenly that the boy
just behind narrowly escaped running into him.
Throwing back his head, he sent peal after peal
of laughter ringing through the silent woods. The
scouts stared, dazed, as if they thought he had
taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, sir?&#8221; begged two or three voices
at once. &#8220;What&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster choked and gurgled speechlessly,
waving one arm helplessly toward the woods
ahead. Several of the keenest-eyed thought they
saw a vague, dark shadow moving silently across
the snow; but it meant nothing to them, and they
turned back to their leader, as bewildered as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a sell!&#8221; gasped the latter, striving to
regain his self-control; &#8220;what an awful sell!&#8221;
He succeeded in choking down his laughter, but
there were tears of mirth in his eyes as they swept
the staring circle. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing but an owl, fellows,&#8221;
he chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;An owl!&#8221; exclaimed Ted MacIlvaine, incredulously.
&#8220;An owl&#8211;making a noise like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster nodded and wiped his eyes.
&#8220;An owl,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;There! Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>To-whoo-hoo-hoo, to-whoo-whoo.</i> A full, deep-toned
note, like the distant baying of a hound,
was wafted back through the woods. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
strained expression on several faces relaxed,
but they still looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more familiar,&#8221; smiled Mr. Curtis.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great horned owl. You look as if you
didn&#8217;t believe it yet, Bob,&#8221; he added, &#8220;but that&#8217;s
what it is, all the same. I&#8217;ve never heard it
give that other sound, but I ought to have known&#8211;&#8221;
He broke off, chuckling. &#8220;He certainly gave
us a shock! I suppose we&#8217;ll never hear the end
of it. Let&#8217;s get back to the fire; it&#8217;s sort of
chilly here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They lost no time in following the suggestion.
Back in the cabin they fed the blaze with fresh
wood, and, sleep being out of the question for a
while, gathered close around it, giggling and chattering
and laughingly comparing their emotions
on awakening to that blood-curdling scream coming
out of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was scart stiff,&#8221; frankly confessed Court
Parker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; echoed several voices.</p>

<p>But Bob Gibson declined to treat the incident
with the careless levity of the others. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to shoot the beast!&#8221; he growled vindictively, thinking
of the way his nerves and feelings had been
played upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be the best thing that could happen,&#8221;
put in Mr. Curtis, decidedly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
if we can&#8217;t manage it. Most owls are not only
harmless, but a real benefit, living as they do
mainly on rats and mice. But this creature can
do more damage than any other bird except one or
two species of hawks. A single one of them will
destroy whole covies of quail, kill partridges,
ducks, and song-birds, to say nothing of all sorts
of domestic fowls. I&#8217;ll have to bring out a shotgun
and see if I can&#8217;t pot him, or there won&#8217;t be
any birds left for us to feed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made several trips to the neighborhood of
the cabin during the following ten days, but it
was not until the week after Christmas that he
got sight of the big marauder and with a fine
shot brought him down from the top of a tall
hemlock. Several of the scouts who were with
him rushed forward to secure the bird, and were
surprised at the size of the buff-and-white body,
with its great spread of wing, fierce, hooked beak,
and prominent ear-tufts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to have him stuffed,&#8221; said Frank
Sanson, holding it up at full length. &#8220;He&#8217;d certainly
make a dandy trophy for the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis agreed to undertake it, and that night
sent the bird to a taxidermist in the city. It came
back several weeks later, mounted in the most
lifelike manner, and became one of the principal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
decorations of the cabin. Court at once christened
it &#8220;Bob&#8217;s alarm-clock,&#8221; much to the mystification
of the fellows who had not been present on that
memorable night. They knew that something unusual
had happened, but were never able to find
out just what, for the &#8220;advance-guard,&#8221; as the
seven called themselves, kept the incident carefully
to themselves, and Mr. Curtis never told.</p>

<p>Long before this an ample supply of grain had
been taken out to their headquarters and several
feeding-stations established in different parts of
the woods. These consisted mainly of rough shelters
made of saplings, hemlock boughs, or stacks
of old corn-stalks, furnished by Mr. Grimstone, in
which the grain was scattered. There could be no
question of their value, for from the first the
snow about them was covered with bird-tracks of
every variety. Before long, too, scouts visiting
these stations to replenish the supply reported
that the birds were growing noticeably tamer. Instead
of flying off at the first sight of the boys, they
sat in the trees and bushes around the shelters with
an air almost of expectancy. Later they took to
swooping down on the grain the moment it was
poured out, without waiting for the scouts to move
away. The climax came when one day Dale Tompkins
excitedly reported that: &#8220;A chickadee came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
and lit right on the bag to-day, sir. He didn&#8217;t
seem a bit afraid, and only hopped off when I began
to scatter the grain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll do more than that if you treat them
right,&#8221; returned the scoutmaster. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known
of several cases where not only chickadees, but
wrens and juncos and snow-sparrows and even
wilder birds have grown so fearless that they&#8217;ve
fed readily from the hand. Why don&#8217;t you fellows
try it? The main thing is to get them used to
your bringing food to a certain place, and, when
they&#8217;re about, not to make any sudden movement
that might frighten them. It would be rather fun
to see how many varieties you could tame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea met with general favor and when put
into practice was remarkably successful. There
also developed not a little good-natured rivalry
among the boys as to which would first report the
presence of a new bird at the feeding-stations; all
of which helped to keep up the interest in the work
and prevent it becoming monotonous and tiresome.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BOY WHO COULDN&#8217;T SWIM</span></h2>

<p>The usual January thaw carried away most
of the snow and made things generally
sloppy and unpleasant. But it was followed by
another cold snap, which put a glassy surface on
the lake and drew the boys thither in greater
numbers than ever. Almost every afternoon as
soon as school was out a crowd of scouts, with
skates slung about their necks and hockey-sticks in
hand, might have been seen hurrying along the
turnpike. Those who owned wheels made use
of them; the others rode &#8220;shanks&#8217; mare,&#8221; skylarking
as they went and hilariously seizing every
chance of a lift that came along.</p>

<p>Nor were they all members of Troop Five by
any means. Mr. Grimstone had needed very little
persuasion to grant the privileges of the lake to
Hillsgrove scouts generally, and many were the
exciting games of hockey that enlivened the winter
afternoons. More often than not the clear,
cold ring of steel on ice, the grate of swiftly turning
runners, the sharp crack of wood against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
wood, the excited shouts and yells of shrill young
voices, resounded on the lake until the gathering
twilight made it difficult to distinguish one swiftly
moving figure from another.</p>

<p>From its rocky elevation the log-cabin overlooked
the active scene, smoke rising from its
hospitable chimney and the red glow of a blazing
fire gleaming in the windows and winking through
the often opened door. Here congregated those
who were too indifferent or unskilful to indulge in
hockey, while every now and then a player would
dash in to thaw out. On Fridays there was pretty
sure to be a crowd spending the night there, and
then the odor of crisping bacon or broiling chops
mingled with the fragrance of the pines; the
laughter and joshing kept up throughout the evening,
and from the gray farmhouse across the lake
an old man, glimpsing the cheery yellow gleam,
would chuckle to himself and rub his knotted hands
softly together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them boys are havin&#8217; a good time ag&#8217;in to-night,&#8221;
he would murmur. &#8220;Reckon I&#8217;ll hev&#8217; to
step over an&#8217; see &#8217;em in the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whenever he appeared he was sure of a hearty
welcome, for underneath that crustiness, caused
by years of loneliness and narrow living, the scouts
had found a spirit as young and simple and likable,
almost, as a boy&#8217;s. And the old man, reveling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
in this novel, pleasant intercourse, felt sometimes
as if he were beginning life all over again.</p>

<p>In this wise the winter passed with its usual
mingling of work and play. Coasting, hockey,
snow hikes, and the like mixed healthfully with
regular lessons, the bird-feeding, studying up for
merit badges or first- or second-class tests, and
other scout duties and activities. The skating,
particularly, was unusually prolonged, and the
first signs of March thaws met with general
regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can have one more good game, anyhow,&#8221;
remarked Frank Sanson, as they came out
of school at noon. &#8220;Maybe it will be a little soft,
but it will bear all right. Who&#8217;s going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were a number of affirmative replies,
though the general opinion seemed to be that the
ice would be too sloppy to have much fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try it, anyhow,&#8221; Frank declared,
as he got on his wheel. &#8220;See you fellows out
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take any chances before we come,&#8221; Sherman
Ward called after him. &#8220;Remember you
can&#8217;t swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sanson sniffed and shouted back a hasty denial
of the charge. Nevertheless, as he rode home for
dinner he was glad the time was coming when no
one would be able even to hint at his deficiencies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
in that line. When it came to taking care of
themselves in the water the boys of Hillsgrove had
been more or less handicapped in the past, and
like a number of others, Frank could swim only a
few strokes. This spring, however, with the lake
at his disposal, he meant to devote every spare
minute to gaining proficiency in the art, so that
when the time came for their summer camp he
need ask no odds from anybody.</p>

<p>He finished dinner early and, with skates and
hockey-stick, rode briskly out to the lake. He expected
to be the first one there, but on the wood-road
he noticed the fresh tracks of another bicycle,
and, reaching the cabin, he found Paul Trexler
standing before the fireplace, in which a lively
blaze was going.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! You couldn&#8217;t have had much dinner,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought it with me,&#8221; exclaimed the boy, who
was a rather silent lad with an unusual capacity
for enjoying his own company. &#8220;Anybody else
coming out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; quite a bunch. Tried the ice yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I was just going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ahead, then,&#8221; urged Sanson, briskly.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be about our last chance, and I don&#8217;t want
to lose any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They put on their skates at the edge of the lake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
and then tested the ice. It was noticeably soft,
especially near the shore, but seemed firm enough.
Farther out it was better, and as they skated up
and down together Frank decided that they would
have their game even if they did get pretty wet
before it was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll go up a ways and sort of explore
a little,&#8221; said Trexler, presently. It was almost
his first remark since leaving the cabin, and his
tone did not indicate any special desire for
company.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded Sanson. &#8220;Go ahead, only
be careful about the ice. Mr. Grimstone says
there are springs up there, and you know this is
just the weather to make them dangerous.&#8221; For
a moment or two he stood watching the thin,
stooping figure sweeping up the lake; then he
smiled. &#8220;He&#8217;s a queer duck,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;I should think he&#8217;d get awful tired of just playing
around with himself that way. Wish the others
would hurry up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no signs of them, however, so he set
himself to master an intricate figure he had been
trying for several days past. Though there were
no swimming facilities about the village, the annual
flooding and freezing over of a flat meadow
on the outskirts gave the fellows a very decent
chance for skating, of which most of them had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
availed themselves. Sanson was one of the most
proficient in the sport and enjoyed it thoroughly,
especially now that the spacious lake gave them so
much greater scope. His runners cut the ice in
sweeping, graceful curves, and each time the momentum
carried him nearer to the completion of
the figure. Once or twice he noticed Trexler up
toward the outlet, but it was in a vague sort of
way, with a mind concentrated on his own evolutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming all right,&#8221; he said aloud, pausing
for a second to get his breath. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the
hang of it now. One more try and I can make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Fate willed otherwise. As a matter of fact,
Frank did not make that final effort which was to
bring him success. He skated over to a clear spot
on the ice and was swinging along to get up speed
when a sudden panicky cry from up the lake made
him stop and whirl around with a grind of steel
runners that threw up a shower of icy particles.</p>

<p>Trexler was nowhere to be seen! For a fraction
of a second Frank stared open-mouthed at
the bare expanse of ice narrowing to the outlet,
spanned by the old stone bridge. Then his sweeping
glance paused at a dark, irregular patch in the
glistening surface where something seemed to
move feebly, and with a smothered cry he dug his
skates into the ice and sped up the lake.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/illus4.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
The stick slid over the jagged edges of the hole
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>The distance was not really great, but to the
frightened boy it seemed interminable. Almost
at once he recognized the spot as open water in
the midst of which Trexler&#8217;s white face and clawing
hands striving frantically for a hold on the
treacherous, splintering edges stood out with horrible
distinctness&#8211;Trexler, who could not swim
a stroke!</p>

<p>Frank shuddered and dug his teeth into his under
lip. For the matter of that, he himself was
almost as helpless. With a sick, sinking pang it
was borne in on him that the few halting strokes
he had learned to take in smooth water last summer
would be next to useless in an emergency like
this. But he did not pause nor lessen his speed.
He only knew that he could not hesitate, with that
anguished face and those clutching hands to spur
him on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute longer, Paul!&#8221; he cried,
when he was within twenty feet of the hole.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let go. I&#8211;I&#8217;ll&#8211;get you out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerking at the lever of his skates, he kicked them
off. The hockey-stick was still in his grasp, and,
with this outstretched, he flung himself flat on the
ice and wriggled forward. He paid no heed to the
ominous cracking beneath him; there was no time
for caution. Trexler had lost the slight grip he
had had on the crumbling edges of the hole and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
was beating the water madly with his hands. His
eyes, wild with despairing horror, were fixed on
Frank with a desperate pleading that made the boy
oblivious to everything save the vital need of
haste.</p>

<p>With a sharp thrust of both feet, he pushed himself
forward. The stick slid over the jagged edges
of the hole and straight into the groping hands
that closed over and hung upon it with the tenacious
grip that knows no reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t jerk it!&#8221; cried Sanson, sharply, as the
ice creaked and cracked beneath him. &#8220;Just hold
tight and let me draw you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Trexler was too far gone to heed. There
came another crack more ominous than the others.
Even now, by letting go the stick, Frank could
have escaped by rolling swiftly to one side or the
other. He wanted to&#8211;desperately; but something
within him stronger even than his fear
clenched his fingers around the tape-wound hickory.</p>

<p>In another second the ice on which he lay gave
with a crash and plunged him into the icy water.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>As he went under, Sanson&#8217;s first feeling was
one of utter panic. The shock and cold,
above all the horrible sense of suffocation, started
him struggling as madly and ineffectually as Trexler
had done a moment before. Then all at once,
out of the whirling turmoil of fear which filled his
soul, some vague remembrance of the brief lessons
last summer stood forth, and he thrust downward
with his feet. The motion was almost entirely instinctive,
but the result was curiously steadying.
The moment that downward movement ceased, his
brain seemed to clear and he got a grip on himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t come up under the ice,&#8221; he found
himself thinking, as he pushed vigorously upward
again.</p>

<p>Then his head cleaved the water and he gulped
in the blessed air in long, deep breaths. An instant
later this was cut off by the grip of arms
about his neck as Trexler, whom he had momentarily
forgotten, clutched at him with all the
strength and determination of despair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>That there were approved methods of releasing
such grips Frank knew from repeated perusals
of the scout handbook, but not a vestige of
them stuck in his mind now. Full of wild panic,
he struck out blindly with all his power. Trexler&#8217;s
head went back under the impact; his grasp
slackened. Sanson had a momentary glimpse of
the white face with half-closed eyes and twisted
lips all a-swirl with water, and again that impulse
that was stronger than panic made him reach
out and catch hold of the boy&#8217;s shoulder. At almost
the same instant something hard grazed his
cheek, and he realized that the force of his blow
had sent him against one side of the hole. With
a grasp of thankfulness, he caught at it, finding the
ice here fairly substantial. He drew Trexler&#8217;s
body closer to him, and for the first time since the
plunge he had a moment in which to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t try and climb out or it&#8217;ll break,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t the fellows come? They
must have got out by now.&#8221; He quite failed to
realize how short a space of time it was since he
had first started to Trexler&#8217;s aid. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hold
on here much longer. I&#8217;m freezing now, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke a little, but he bit his lip and
choked back the sob in his throat. Then, summoning
all his strength, he tried to shout for help,
but the result was a hoarse croak that could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
have been heard a hundred feet away. To his
utter astonishment it was answered from close
at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold tight, Frank; we&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Sherman Ward&#8217;s voice. Sanson could
scarcely believe his senses, even though a moment
later he heard the scrape of skates and the grating
of a sudden stopping. It took him a moment
or two to realize that he had become turned
around and was facing the inlet and the bridge,
so that the fellows had been able to approach
from down the lake without his seeing them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get that branch there,&#8221; he heard Sherman
order crisply. &#8220;Hustle! Can you keep up a bit
longer, Frank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S-s-sure!&#8221; answered Sanson, through chattering
teeth. &#8220;Only be as qu-quick as you c-c-can.
P-P-Paul&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there in half a shake. That&#8217;s it,
Dale. Shove it across. Now, you fellows hold
fast to that end while I go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a scraping sound and the end of a
stout branch appeared in front of Sanson. Then,
more slowly, Sherman&#8217;s head and shoulders came
in sight as he crept cautiously out along it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take him first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can you raise
him up a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not. My arm&#8217;s all numb, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; interrupted the patrol-leader.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll manage. Hold fast back there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wriggled forward a bit more and, reaching
down, managed to catch Trexler under the arms.
To draw him out of the water was a more difficult
business, but Sherman had good muscles and accomplished
it without accident. The ice creaked
and groaned, but evidently had not been much
weakened by the treacherous spring, and it held.
The arm with which Frank had been supporting
the boy had absolutely no feeling in it, and the
strain of gripping the slippery ice was growing
unendurable. He shifted his hold to the stick,
however, and a moment later he was half lifted,
half helped out on the solid ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours for the cabin, quick!&#8221; said Ward,
tersely. &#8220;Here, Ted, give us a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>MacIlvaine stepped quickly forward, and together
they hustled Sanson across the ice. At
first, Frank could scarcely move his feet and had
to be practically carried along. But gradually
the rapid motion, the stumbling, recovering, and
general jolting-up began to send the blood tingling
back into his chilled body. Ahead of them he
could see Ranleigh and Dale Tompkins supporting
Trexler, and making even better speed than
his own conductors. The sight of that limp body,
with one hand dangling helplessly, brought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
Frank a sudden stinging pang of remorse and apprehension
as he remembered the frenzied blow
he had struck the fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul&#8211;&#8221; he gasped; &#8220;is he&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the cold and shock mostly, I think,&#8221; answered
Sherman. &#8220;He&#8217;s all in, but not really
unconscious. Did he go down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. Not more than once, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no more conversation until after they
reached the cabin. Frank was able to stumble up
the rocky slope unaided, and, once inside, his
clothes were stripped off and he was rolled in
blankets that had been heated before the roaring
blaze. Muffled in these, with some of the boys
deftly rubbing his legs and arms, it wasn&#8217;t long
before a delicious languor crept over him and he
actually felt like dozing off to sleep.</p>

<p>He might have yielded to the impulse but for
his anxiety about Trexler. Paul lay in the opposite
bunk and was being subjected to the same
treatment as Frank, but he did not seem to be responding
as readily as the more robust fellow. Of
course, he had been longer exposed to the cold and
shock, but Sanson did not think of that. He was
still worrying over the ruthless manner in which
he had struck the boy, and fearful that in some
way the blow might be responsible for Trexler&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
condition. When Mr. Curtis and the doctor appeared,
summoned by one of the fellows who had
ridden hastily back to town on his wheel, Frank
watched them apprehensively. When the scoutmaster
at length came over to his bunk he sat up
abruptly and poured forth his doubts and fears
before the older man had time to say a word.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis listened quietly, and when the boy
had finished he smiled reassuringly and shook his
head. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry about that, Frank,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The doctor says he&#8217;ll come around all
right. He&#8217;s pretty well done up from the exposure
and shock, and you know he&#8217;s never been so
very strong. I don&#8217;t think your hitting him has
had much to do with it, but even if it had, no one
could blame you. It was a question of that, or of
both of you going down, and in such an emergency
almost any methods are right. How are you feeling
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right now, sir. There&#8217;s nothing
at all the matter with me. I don&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t
get up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not just yet. There&#8217;s nothing special
you can do. I have a car over by the bridge, and
when Paul is fit to be moved, we&#8217;ll all go back together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got my wheel here,&#8221; protested
Frank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;Let somebody else ride it in,&#8221; returned Mr.
Curtis. &#8220;After such a dousing there&#8217;s no use
taking chances.&#8221; He paused a moment, his eyes
fixed quizzically on the boy&#8217;s face. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
swim, can you, Frank?&#8221; he went on presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir!&#8221; the boy said hastily.</p>

<p>A faint smile curved the man&#8217;s lips. &#8220;How
much?&#8221; he asked quietly. &#8220;About six strokes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sanson flushed, and a guilty grin overspread
his face. &#8220;Make it eight, sir,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;A
fellow can&#8217;t seem to fool you at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you went in after&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; interrupted Frank, earnestly.
&#8220;I was reaching out with my hockey-stick, and
the ice broke and dropped me in. I didn&#8217;t mean
to at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Broke without any warning, I suppose,&#8221;
murmured Mr. Curtis. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t possibly
have escaped&#8211;even by letting go your
stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s flush deepened, and he wriggled uncomfortably.
&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221; he stammered, and then
was silent.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster gave a low, contented laugh,
and something in his glance sent an odd thrill
through Sanson. He didn&#8217;t analyze it. He only
knew that all at once he had ceased to feel embarrassed
and was happy and comfortable, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
back of it all not a little proud of the thing which
had won his scoutmaster&#8217;s commendation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bother you any more,&#8221; smiled Mr.
Curtis, as he turned away. &#8220;I had an idea that
was about how it happened, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pleasant glow crept over the boy, continuing
even after he had got into his clothes and was
making his way along the shore toward the bridge.
It was still present to a certain extent next day,
and, combined with a touch of remorse that lingered
in the back of his mind, brought him in the
afternoon to the Trexler house to inquire for Paul,
who had not appeared at school. He did not expect
to see the boy, and when Mrs. Trexler asked
him to come in, he was seized with a mild sort of
panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid of a cold, so I kept him home
to-day. I know he&#8217;ll want to see you,&#8221; she said
as Frank stepped into the hall and closed the door
reluctantly behind him. &#8220;I want to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, and Frank, flashing a
single startled glance at her, saw that her eyes
were full of tears. Instantly he dropped his own
and stood awkwardly twisting his cap and wishing
he hadn&#8217;t come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know boys hate being thanked,&#8221; Mrs. Trexler
went on presently in a voice which wasn&#8217;t
quite steady, &#8220;so I won&#8217;t pester you with&#8211;with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
mother&#8217;s gratitude. I just want you to let
me&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent over suddenly and kissed him on the
forehead. The boy flushed crimson and mumbled
something about its being only what any fellow
would have done. Would Paul go on this way,
too, he wondered apprehensively as he followed
her down the hall. He supposed it was natural
for a woman to get all worked up, but if a fellow&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one to see you, Paul,&#8221; said Mrs. Trexler,
cheerfully, pausing beside an open doorway.</p>

<p>She motioned for Frank to enter and then, to
his relief, departed, leaving the two boys alone.
Paul had been reading beside a window, but as
Sanson appeared he stood up slowly. Though
looking much better than he had the afternoon
before, his face was still a little pale, and the
visitor perceived, with a sudden sense of returning
composure, that he, too, was overcome with
embarrassment. Somehow the discovery made
things a lot easier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m awfully glad you came in,&#8221; Trexler
stammered. He put out his hand awkwardly, but
there was a vigor in his lingering grip that told
something of the feelings words refused to express.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;weren&#8217;t in school, so I thought maybe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
you were&#8211;sick, or something,&#8221; Sanson returned.
&#8220;Gee! What a dandy room!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the worst was over he began to be
rather glad he had come, and stared about him
with eager interest. Certainly it was a room to
excite any boy&#8217;s enthusiasm. Long and rather
narrow, there were two windows on one side
through which the winter sun poured cheerfully.
Against the opposite wall, and filling almost the
entire space, was a large glass-fronted case, containing
the most amazingly realistic reproduction
of woodland life the boy had ever seen.</p>

<p>Fastened in one corner was the gnarled crotch
of a tree with a great, roughly built nest of twigs
and leaves from which two baby hawks, their
down just giving place to feathers, thrust up inquiring
heads. At the other end of the case
stood a section of a silvery white oak, with one
long branch extending along the back. An owl
perched here, teased by a blackbird with outstretched
wings and open beak, and there were
several birds&#8217;-nests among the branches. The
lower part of the case was filled with small
bushes, clumps of grass, and reeds, among which
Frank noted quantities of other nests, some with
eggs and some without, more mounted birds of
various sorts, and several animals, such as a mink,
two squirrels, and a skunk, all in the most lifelike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
attitudes. Turning from an eager inspection of
the case, he stared at Trexler in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest thing I ever saw!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Do you mean to say you did it all yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul nodded, his pale face tinged with color,
his eyes sparkling. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t hard when you
know how to stuff things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I took lessons
in the city before we came out here last year.
It&#8217;s been lots of fun fixing them up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how the deuce did you get &#8217;em all?&#8221; Frank
turned quickly back to the case again. &#8220;You must
be a dandy shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not! I hate to kill things&#8211;especially
birds. You see, I go off for long tramps a lot,
and in the winter especially you often find birds
that have been frozen, or killed by flying into
things. Some of them people gave me. A farmer
that I know out near Alton shot that skunk and
the mink in his chicken-yard. The quail and that
woodcock came from down South. A cousin of
mine sent them up, and I got Mother to let me
take the skins off before she cooked them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the hawks&#8211;those are hawks,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Red-shouldered hawks. I s&#8217;pose I
oughtn&#8217;t to have taken them, but I wanted to try
taming some. I knew where there was a nest, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
last spring I got up the tree with climbers and took
two. They were awful funny the way they&#8217;d sit
up and cry whenever they saw me coming. I guess
I must have fed &#8217;em too much, or something, for
they died in about a week. I won&#8217;t try it again,
you bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul looked rather sheepish as he made this confession,
and hurried on to another subject.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the same way about the eggs. I used to take
only one out of a nest, but Mr. Curtis said even
that was pretty hard on the birds, so I stopped.
I haven&#8217;t taken any since I&#8217;ve been a scout. It&#8217;s
more fun, really, taking pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pictures of birds&#8217; eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, eggs and nests and birds&#8211;anything wild.
It&#8217;s dandy sport. I&#8217;ve got quite a lot of good
ones if you&#8217;d like to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank quickly acquiesced, and as Paul went over
to a desk for the photograph book, his eyes
followed the boy with an odd expression in them.
Hitherto he had regarded Trexler with a certain
measure of tolerance as a queer, unsociable sort
of fellow, who seldom took part in the sports and
pastimes of the troop, but preferred moping by
himself. It had never occurred to him that the
solitary rambles could be productive of anything
like the results he saw about him. As he glanced
again at the case, a dawning respect began to fill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
him for the boy who could do all this and yet
remain so modest that not a whisper of it leaked
out among his companions.</p>

<p>That respect deepened as Frank turned the
pages of the album and examined scores of photographs
of feathered wild things. There were
not alone pictures of the commoner birds, but
many of the shyer sort, like the cardinal, the
oven-bird, and several varieties of thrush which
rarely emerge from the deep woodland, and they
had been taken in all sorts of positions. Trexler
had even succeeded in getting a very good photograph
of the great blue heron, and his account of
the difficulties of that enterprise filled Sanson with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be great!&#8221; he exclaimed eagerly. &#8220;I
wish I could go along with you some time and see
how you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you? I&#8217;d like to have you&#8211;awfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking the earnestness of
the invitation, and Frank took it up promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; that&#8217;s a go. You let me know the
next time you go out, and I&#8217;ll be there like a runaway
freight-train.&#8221; He rose to go, for to his
surprise it was growing dark; he had no idea he
had stayed so long. &#8220;You&#8217;ve certainly got a corking
place here,&#8221; he said, glancing around for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
last time. &#8220;Why, you ought to be able to rake in
a whole lot of merit badges. There&#8217;s taxidermy
and bird study and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only a second-class scout,&#8221; interrupted
Trexler, briefly. He flushed a little and twisted
his fingers together. &#8220;You see, I&#8211;can&#8217;t swim.
But I&#8217;m going to learn,&#8221; he added determinedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to start in the minute the water&#8217;s
warm enough and keep it up till I get the hang
of it, even if it takes all summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; laughed Frank, as they reached
the front door. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be two dubs together,
won&#8217;t we? Good-by, and thanks for showing
me all the stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the street he thrust both hands deep in
his pockets and started briskly homeward, whistling.
Presently he stopped and laughed rather
sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It&#8217;s funny how you can
get a fellow&#8217;s number wrong&#8211;it sure is!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>TREXLER&#8217;S TRANSFORMATION</span></h2>

<p>Sanson&#8217;s account of his visit to Paul Trexler
was received at first with a good deal of incredulity.
But when he persisted that he wasn&#8217;t
trying to play any trick general curiosity was
aroused among the fellows, and they began to drop
in at the Trexler house to see for themselves the
wonderful case of birds and the even more wonderful
photographs. Before he knew it Paul became
almost a public character.</p>

<p>At first he did not like it at all. Excessively
shy by nature, he had gone his solitary way for
so long that he didn&#8217;t know how to take the jokes
and banter and mild horse-play of a crowd of boys.
But gradually he grew accustomed to it, and when
he found that the fellows weren&#8217;t making fun of
him, as he at first supposed, but really regarded
him with a marked respect for his unusual talents,
he began actually to enjoy the situation.</p>

<p>He came to know the boys better, to find pleasure
in their companionship. He no longer went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
off on those solitary tramps, for there was always
some one ready and eager to accompany him.
And little by little even these excursions began to
grow slightly less frequent as he discovered, with
a mild surprise, that there was a good deal of fun
to be extracted from the regular sports and games
and doings of the crowd.</p>

<p>Frank Sanson was mainly responsible for this.
Keen, eager, full of enthusiasm about everything,
he flung himself into all the school and troop activities
with a zest which made him one of the
livest boys in Hillsgrove. He could enjoy an
occasional tramp in the woods with Trexler because
of the novelty and interest of their search;
but he could not understand any one wanting to
devote himself exclusively to such an occupation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You miss half your life in not going more with
the fellows, Paul,&#8221; he remarked one day in early
April. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you leave the old camera at
home and come on up to the ball-field with me?
We&#8217;re going to have a great old practice to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t play baseball,&#8221; protested Trexler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! How do you know? Did you ever
try?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-o, but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time you started in, then,&#8221; interrupted
Sanson. &#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t expect to make
the team this year, but you&#8217;ll have a lot of fun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
playing with the scrub. Hustle up or we&#8217;ll be
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Trexler went, mainly because he didn&#8217;t exactly
know how to refuse the boy he had come to
like so much. But it was with a good deal of inward
trepidation that he trailed after Frank to
where Ranny Phelps, who captained the team, was
chatting with Mr. Curtis&#8217;s younger brother, just
home for the Easter holidays. He had a feeling
that he was going to make an awful exhibition of
himself, and that conviction was not lessened by
the slight lifting of the eyebrows with which Ranny
greeted Frank&#8217;s request that his friend be allowed
to practise with the others.</p>

<p>But out in the field, nervously adjusting a borrowed
glove, Paul was conscious of an odd, tingling
sensation altogether different from apprehension.
The day was typically April and fairly
breathed of spring. Birds darted hither and
thither, singing joyously. Beyond the low stone
wall at one side the feathery outlines of a wild
cherry, pale green, with touches of white blossoms
just bursting into bloom, was etched against the
sky in delicate tracery. Farther still, a man was
plowing, and from the long straight furrows came
that moist, fresh, homely smell of newly turned
earth that one gets only in springtime. Out of
the deep blue sky, flecked with fluffy, idly drifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
clouds, the sun shone warm and caressing. From
all about came the sound of quick, clear, eager
voices, to which was presently added the crack of
leather meeting wood, the thud of feet drumming
the turf, and the duller sound of leather pounding
against leather.</p>

<p>There was something about it all that stirred the
boy and sent the blood running like quick-silver
through his veins, yet which made him feel curiously
alone and out of it. Other springs had
meant to him the beautiful awakening of nature,
the return of the birds he loved, the charm of
wood and stream and open country-side at its best.
But somehow that failed to satisfy him as it had
in the past. Vaguely he felt that something was
missing, he could not say just what. A feeling
of emulation stirred him, a desire to take his part
in the clash and struggle and ceaseless competition
from which, till now, he had held aloof. Admiringly,
with a faint touch of envy, he watched Frank
Sanson make a difficult one-hand stop with seeming
ease. Why hadn&#8217;t he come out before and
learned the game and how to uphold his end with
the others? Was it too late even now? he wondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Paul! Get under this one!&#8221;</p>

<p>The shout from Sanson roused Trexler to the
realization that a fly was coming in his direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
He ran back a little, then forward. The ball
seemed to be dropping with the speed of a cannon-shot,
but he forced himself to meet it without
shrinking. Thrusting up his hands awkwardly,
he staggered a bit under its momentum, as he
caught at it, and a burning sting tingled in the
bare palm which had taken most of the impact.
The ball, bouncing off, rolled to one side, and a
laugh went round the field as he chased after it
and threw it in. When he returned to his place
Paul&#8217;s face was crimson, but his lips were set in
a stubborn line and he scarcely noticed the pain
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> get the hang of it!&#8221; he muttered under
his breath. &#8220;I&#8217;ll learn to do it right if&#8211;if it takes
all season!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stuck to his position as long as any of the
others, and on the way home, with some embarrassment,
he spoke to Frank of his determination.
The latter was delighted and offered to help
him in any way he could. As a result, from that
time forth the two rarely went anywhere without
a baseball. Whenever there were a few minutes to
spare they used them for throwing and catching.
On the field, before and after the regular work,
Frank knocked out flies or grounders, and in many
other ways did his best to give his friend as much
as possible of the practice he needed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>A baseball player isn&#8217;t easily made to order.
The normal boy seems almost to absorb his knowledge
of the game through the pores of his skin,
gaining proficiency by constant, never-ending
practice that usually begins as soon as he is big
enough to throw a ball. But much can be done
by dogged persistence, and Paul Trexler had
that quality to a marked degree. As the days
passed, dust began to gather on his camera and
on the cover of his book of bird photographs. In
this new and strenuous occupation he found little
time for the things which had formally absorbed
him. He regretted the many long tramps he had
planned, but somehow he failed to miss them as
much as he expected. Each noticeable improvement
in his game filled him with a deep, abiding
satisfaction, surpassing even the delight which
he used to feel on securing a fine photograph. The
climax came that afternoon when he was allowed
to play on the scrub in place of one of the fielders
who had not shown up. Not only did he fail to
make any mirth-provoking blunders, but he even
put through one play that brought forth a surprised,
approving comment from Ranny Phelps
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve been doing to him,
Frank,&#8221; the latter said to Sanson, who passed on
the remark afterward. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen anybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
improve the way he has. That catch wasn&#8217;t
anything wonderful, of course, but when he threw
to third he used his head, which is more than a
lot of fellows right here on the field ever think of
doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter part of the speech, especially, was
typical of the handsome Ranleigh. He ran the
ball-team as he did a good many other things,
reaching decisions more often through impulse and
prejudice than from a mature judgment. There
could be no question of his knowledge of the game
or his ability as a pitcher. The latter was really
extraordinary for a fellow of his age and experience,
and this, perhaps, was what made him so intolerant
of less gifted players. At all events, he
had a little trick of sarcasm which did not endear
him to those on whom it was exercised. Most fellows
take the ordinary sort of &#8220;calling down,&#8221;
especially if it has been earned, with a fair amount
of grace, but it rarely does any good to rub it in, as
Ranny so often did.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think he was a little tin god on wheels
the way he struts up and down, digging into the
fellows in that uppish, sneering way,&#8221; Court Parker
heatedly remarked one afternoon late in the
season. &#8220;You might think he never made any
errors himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose he really means anything by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
it,&#8221; returned Dale Tompkins, rather deprecatingly.
For some time that day he had been watching
Phelps and wondering rather wistfully whether
Ranny was ever going to entirely forget that impulsive
flare-up of his so many months ago. For a
long time, to be sure, there had been few signs of
active animosity from the blond chap. It would be
well-nigh impossible for any boy to long maintain
that excessive coldness toward a fellow with whom
he was so often and so intimately thrown. Especially
since the beginning of baseball practice there
had been a good deal of intercourse between them,
but always Dale was conscious of a deep reserve
looming up between them like some invisible, insurmountable
barrier. And there were times when he
would have given the world to break that barrier
down.</p>

<p>Parker sniffed. &#8220;Then why does he do it? It
only gets the fellows raw without doing a scrap
of good. You&#8217;re a great one to stand up for him,
Tommy! He&#8217;s treated you mean as dirt.
Didn&#8217;t he promise to let you pitch in some of the
games?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, n-o; it wasn&#8217;t exactly a promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the same thing. He made you think
he was going to put you in, and all spring you&#8217;ve
worked your arm nearly off, pitching to the
bunch. Then when a regular game came along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
he stepped into the box himself and hogged the
whole thing nine innings. It&#8217;s been the same ever
since, except last week when you went in for one
miserable inning after we&#8217;d won the game. I call
that a&#8211;a&#8211;an insult. It looked as if he thought
you weren&#8217;t any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Maybe he does,&#8221;
he returned quietly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a lot better pitcher
than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he? Humph! He&#8217;s nowhere near as
steady, let me tell you. Wait till he gets up
against a real team, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder a
bit if he blew up. He did last year, and we mighty
near lost the series. He can&#8217;t stand being joshed,
and Troop One is just the bunch to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale laughed a little and set down his companion&#8217;s
disparaging remarks to temper rather than
to any real belief in what he was saying. He had
never seen Ranny pitch before this season, but he
could not imagine him losing his superb control
and &#8220;blowing up.&#8221; He would have given anything
for a chance to pitch against Troop One, but
he had long ago given up hoping, Ranny made
it only too clear that he meant to keep that honor
for himself, just as he had monopolized the pitching
in all the other games. Dale couldn&#8217;t quite
make up his mind whether this was from a deliberate
desire to shut him out, or because the team
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
captain really lacked faith in his ability and was
afraid to trust him. Feeling as he did toward the
other&#8211;liking, admiring him still, almost in spite
of himself, Tompkins rather hoped it was the latter
case. In either event, however, he was
obliged to content himself with the cold comfort
that with Ranleigh Phelps pitching his best Troop
Five was practically certain to win.</p>

<p>The inter-troop baseball series had been arranged
so that the two strongest teams were
matched together on the concluding day. Both
had won every game they had played so far, and
the result this Saturday afternoon would decide
the championship.</p>

<p>Naturally there was a big crowd of spectators.
Practically every boy in town was present, ready
to root for his favorite team, and the grand stand
was well filled with older enthusiasts.</p>

<p>When Troop Five won the toss and spread out
on the field, Dale Tompkins, with a faint sigh,
dropped down on the bench he had ornamented
for most of the season. Watching Ranny Phelps
walking out to the mound, a wave of envy, pure
and simple, swept over him. He wanted to pitch&#8211;desperately.
At that moment he would have
welcomed almost any contingency&#8211;even the unthinkable
&#8220;blowing up&#8221; that Court had predicted&#8211;that
would give him his chance. He had done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
practically nothing all the season, and it seemed
unfair that the last game should come without
giving him a single opportunity of showing his
mettle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of trying at all if you never
get a show?&#8221; he thought disconsolately.</p>

<p>But the mood did not last long. Dale was too
keen a baseball fan not to become swiftly absorbed
in the game which meant so much to himself
and his brother scouts. There could be no
question of Ranny&#8217;s fine form. For the first five
innings not a hit was scored against him. To be
sure, several players made first on various errors,
but none got beyond third, and in the meantime
Troop Five had scored two runs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly some pitcher!&#8221; Tompkins remarked
rather wistfully to Paul Trexler, who had
taken a seat beside him. &#8220;Looks as if we had the
game cinched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so. If only he don&#8217;t&#8211;er&#8211;blow up&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blow up!&#8221; interrupted Tompkins, sharply.
&#8220;Does he act like it? You&#8217;ve been listening to
Court Parker&#8217;s rubbish, Paul. I never saw any
fellow pitch a steadier game.&#8221;</p>

<p>But though he had been swift to deny the possibility,
Trexler&#8217;s remark lingered in Dale&#8217;s mind,
and almost unconsciously he began to watch for
signs which might confirm it. The fellows that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
composed the rival team were rather older than
the average scout and of a certain rough-and-ready
type which made their joshing apt to carry
more sting than that sort of thing usually does.
So far, however, there had been little in the
pitcher&#8217;s manner or behavior for them to take
hold of, and the stream of commonplace chatter
and joking seemed to affect Ranny as little as water
does a duck. He took it carelessly, with now
and then an apt retort which turned the laugh
against the other fellows, and throughout the sixth
and seventh innings his work continued to show
much of the smooth perfection it had displayed
from the first.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of the eighth that
Tompkins&#8217;s face began to grow a little troubled.
Ranny had several rather noticeable mannerisms,
which were especially apt to appear on the flood-tide
of success. Whether deliberately or not, he
had hitherto suppressed them, but now he seemed
momentarily to relax his vigilance.</p>

<p>He had struck out the first batter, and as the
second stepped up to face him the pitcher paused,
swept the grand stand with a leisurely glance,
and then tossed back his head in an odd, rather
affected gesture before starting to wind up. The
gesture had probably originated on the gridiron,
where hair is worn rather long and is apt to trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
into one&#8217;s eyes; here it looked a bit foolish, and
instantly one of the opposition, who was coaching
at first base, a red-headed fellow named Conners,
seized upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;See him shake his mane, fellows!&#8221; he yelled
in a shrill falsetto. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him scare you,
Blakie; he&#8217;s tame!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be the goat, all right, before we get
done with him,&#8221; chimed in another.</p>

<p>Ranny hesitated an instant in his swing, bit
his lips, and then put the ball over. It was wide,
and, as he caught the return, there was an angry
flush on his handsome face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t he blush sweetly?&#8221; shrilled Conners,
dancing about off first. &#8220;He&#8217;d make a peach of
a girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny wound up hastily and pitched again. It
was a straight, speedy ball, but in his annoyance
he must have forgotten that this was just the
sort Blake liked. The latter met it squarely with
a clean crack that brought Dale&#8217;s heart into his
mouth and jerked him to his feet to watch with
tight lips and despairing eyes the soaring flight
of the white sphere over the diamond and on&#8211;on&#8211;seemingly
to the very limits of the outfield!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>DALE&#8217;S CHANCE</span></h2>

<p>To Tompkins, watching with bated breath and
clenched fists, it seemed as if the ball would
never drop. Two of the fielders were running
swiftly backward, but there wasn&#8217;t a chance in a
hundred of their catching it. Bat flung aside and
toe-clips digging into the ground, Blake was speeding
toward first. Before the ball hit the turf he
had rounded the sack. By the time Pete Oliver
had recovered it and lined it in, the runner was
panting on second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got him going! Got him going!&#8221; shrieked
Conners, delightedly. &#8220;Get after it, Peanut.
Smash it on the nose and bring in Blakie!&#8221;</p>

<p>His team-mates added their jubilations to his,
and a bedlam of shrill advice, mingled with fresh
joshing, ensued. Ranny&#8217;s eyes flashed with ill-concealed
anger, and he gripped his under lip
tight between his teeth. His first ball was good,
but the batter fell on the second with all his might.
<i>Crack!</i> A gasp went up from the watchers on the
bench. <i>Smack!</i> The gasp merged into a yell of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
delight as the ball landed squarely in Frank Sanson&#8217;s
mitt and stuck there. The force of the impact
nearly upset the short-stop, but he recovered
swiftly and lined the horsehide straight into the
outstretched hands of Court Parker, astride of
third. There was a flashing downward motion of
those hands, and the sliding runner was tagged,
his fingers not six inches from the sack.</p>

<p>To the shout of delight that went up, Dale Tompkins
contributed rather more than his share.
Leaping and capering in front of the bench, it
seemed as if he couldn&#8217;t express his overwhelming
relief at the unexpected ending of the inning and
their escape from a dangerous situation. He
thumped Sanson on the back and poked Court in
the ribs joyously. But when the first excited enthusiasm
had passed he began to think of the inning
yet to be played and to wonder how Ranny
would get through it. Surely there was time to
pull himself together, the boy thought. He hadn&#8217;t
really lost control of himself except for a moment.</p>

<p>With the opening of the ninth it looked as if
Tompkins was right. Troop Five had failed to
score further, but Ranny entered the box apparently
as cool and self-contained as he had been
at the beginning of the game. Quietly and efficiently
he took the first batter in hand, and in spite
of the joshing that at once began on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
side, he lured the boy into popping up a little infield
fly that was easily smothered by the second
baseman.</p>

<p>The next fellow up, however, sent out a long fly
to right-field which Blair unaccountably muffed.
Instantly the shrill, nagging voice of &#8220;Red&#8221; Conners
pierced the din.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up in a balloon!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Little Lambie&#8217;s
ready for the stable. He&#8217;s done. I knew
he couldn&#8217;t stand up before a regular team once
we got his number.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irritating as a mosquito&#8217;s buzz, the strident
voice rasped Dale Tompkins&#8217;s spirit like a file,
and a rush of sympathy for the pitcher swept over
him. He knew how annoying it is to be blamed for
another&#8217;s fault, and the error was distinctly
Blair&#8217;s for muffing that fly. If only Phelps
wouldn&#8217;t pay any attention to the nagging! He
had only to put out two more men and win the
game. Surely he must realize that the fellows
didn&#8217;t mean anything they said; that they were
only trying&#8211;</p>

<p>He caught his breath with a swift, anxious intake
as the ball left Ranny&#8217;s fingers and an instant
later went sailing over the infield. It was
a clean hit and brought forth a roar of delight
from Troop One&#8217;s adherents, who at once redoubled
their efforts to tease the angry pitcher.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
It wasn&#8217;t baseball, in its better sense, nor did
it show the real scout spirit, but it was human
nature. Seeing the game slipping from them, they
took the only way they had been able to discover
to turn the tables. Ranny, plainly furious,
pitched hastily to the next batter and hit him in
the arm. The bases were filled, with only one out.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve rattled him, all right,&#8221; said the regretful
voice of Paul Trexler at Tompkins&#8217;s elbow.
&#8220;Great Scott! He can&#8217;t be going to stick it
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment it looked that way. Flushed and
furious, his snapping eyes sweeping the circle of
grinning faces, Ranny stood motionless for a moment
or two in the middle of the diamond. He
even toed the slab and took a signal from Ted
MacIlvaine. Then, of a sudden, his arm dropped
to his side, and he stalked across the infield toward
the bench. By the time he reached it his face was
white, save where the grip of teeth had left little
crimson dents in his under lip. His level, almost
hostile, glance fixed Dale Tompkins coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in, Tompkins,&#8221; he said curtly, and tossed
him the ball.</p>

<p>Dale caught it instinctively, and, scrambling to
his feet, pulled off his sweater mechanically. His
chance had come, but somehow he did not want it
now. He would infinitely rather have had Ranny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
keep his head and his control and finish the game
he had started off so well. The hurt and shame
in that white face smote on him with a sense of
physical pain, made him feel in a curious, involved
fashion as if he were in some manner responsible
for the humiliation of his hero.</p>

<p>A moment later all this vanished from his mind
as he crossed the diamond, his heart beating unevenly,
every sense concentrated in the task before
him. He was greeted by a burst of joshing
from Conners and the others, but he scarcely heard
it. Quite without self-consciousness as he was,
the remarks of the crowd, with most of whom he
was on friendly terms, meant nothing to him. It
was merely an obvious attempt to rattle him to
which he paid no heed, so intent was he on gaging
the boy who stood, bat in hand, a little to one side
of the plate.</p>

<p>Tompkins had warmed up a little before the
game, and now, after throwing a few to MacIlvaine,
he found the plate and nodded to the
batter to resume his place. All the afternoon he
had been sizing up the different batters, noting
as well as he could the strength and weakness of
each one. He thought he knew the sort of ball
Jack Dillon could not hit safely, and promptly he
proceeded to send it up.</p>

<p>In that very instant something in the fellow&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
face told him that he had blundered. His heart
leaped with the crack of leather meeting wood;
he caught his breath almost with a sob as the ball
whizzed past his vainly reaching arm. There was
no answering thud behind him. Bob Gibson had
missed! Heartsick, he saw the runner shoot down
from third and cross the plate. Close at his heels,
it seemed, the fellow behind him rounded the sack
and started home. Suddenly he doubled back, and
Dale realized with a gasp of thankfulness that
Gardner had nipped that second run with a fine
throw to the plate from center-field.</p>

<p>He was trembling a bit as he caught the ball
from MacIlvaine and moved slowly backward,
turning it nervously in his hands. There was a
sick, sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach.
All about him the opposition were yelling joyously
as if it were only a question of minutes before
the game could be counted theirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another easy mark!&#8221; shrilled Conners.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got him going, too. One good single,
Irish, and we take the lead. Come over here,
Blakie, and coach. I&#8217;m up next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale brought his teeth down hard and his jaw
squared. He&#8217;d show Red Conners who was easy.
Stepping into the box, he met the confident grin
of Roddy Thorpe. This time there could be no
mistake. He knew Roddy&#8217;s game through and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
through. His eyes dropped to where MacIlvaine
crouched, giving a signal from behind his mitt.
He shook his head slightly, and Bob, with some
reluctance, changed the signal for another. Dale
pitched suddenly, and Thorpe, swinging with all
his strength to meet the sort of ball he thought was
coming, missed, with ludicrous dismay.</p>

<p>He fouled the second one, and then let two go
by. Finally he missed again, fooled by a sudden
change of pace and a slow ball when he had expected
speed. A cheer went up from his team-mates
that still further heartened Tompkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s an easy mark now, Red?&#8221; taunted
Frank Sanson, pounding his glove delightedly.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where you get yours, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should worry!&#8221; retorted Conners, dancing
to the plate with every sign of confidence. &#8220;That
was only a fluke; it won&#8217;t last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s eyes narrowed a bit as he surveyed the
grinning, freckled face before him. Ordinarily,
he and Red were on good enough terms, but at this
moment he felt a slow, smoldering anger against
the fellow who, he felt, had been the main cause of
forcing Ranny out of the box. &#8220;Here&#8217;s where I
even up,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>He took Bob&#8217;s signal, and promptly, yet without
apparent haste, he pitched. The ball left his
fingers and whistled over with a slight inswerve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
Conners swung his bat fiercely, but encountered
nothing but empty air.</p>

<p>&#8220;One!&#8221; muttered Tompkins, under his breath.
&#8220;Two more, now&#8211;just two more!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next was a ball, and Conners let it pass.
Then came a slow one delivered with a swing and
snap that fooled the batter into striking before
it was well within his reach. As he regained his
balance he scowled slightly and shook his head.
The grin still stretched his lips, but it had turned
into a grimace.</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s heart began to pound. Over and over
again he was saying to himself: &#8220;One more!
Only one more! I <i>must</i> get him&#8211;I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to!&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence had fallen on the field. The batter&#8217;s
team-mates had left off their gibing. It seemed
as if every fellow gathered about the edges of
the diamond was holding his breath.</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s right hand drew back slowly, and for an
instant he cuddled the ball under his chin. Then,
like a flash, his arm shot forward and a gray
shadow whizzed through the air.</p>

<p>The ball was high&#8211;too high, many a breathless
onlooker thought at first. But suddenly it flashed
downward across Conner&#8217;s shoulders. Too late
the batter saw it drop and brought his bat around.
There was a swish, a thud&#8211;and the umpire&#8217;s voice
was drowned in the shrill yell of relaxing tension
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
that split the throats of the victorious team as they
made a rush for Tompkins, standing in the middle
of the diamond.</p>

<p>Sanson and Bob Gibson reached him first, but
the others were not far behind. Thumping,
pounding, poking him in the ribs and executing
around him an impromptu war-dance, they swept
Dale toward the bench, jabbering excitedly the
while. In a happy sort of daze the boy heard the
hearty congratulations of Mr. Curtis. Then, when
the throng had spread out a little, he suddenly
found himself face to face with Ranleigh Phelps.</p>

<p>For a second there was an embarrassed silence;
then the blond chap put out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did mighty well, Tompkins,&#8221; he said, with
a touch of constraint in his manner. &#8220;I wish&#8211;&#8221;
He paused an instant, and a faint color crept into
his face. &#8220;I&#8217;d just like you to know,&#8221; he went on
rapidly, &#8220;that I haven&#8217;t kept you out of the box
all season because&#8211;because of&#8211;wanting to take
all the pitching myself. I&#8211;I&#8211;didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
make good. I was wrong, of course. I&#8211;I&#8217;m
sorry it&#8217;s too late to&#8211;prove it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all. Without waiting for a reply, he
turned away. But Dale&#8217;s face glowed. Somehow
those brief words from Ranleigh meant more to
him than the exuberant congratulations of all the
others.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A QUESTION OF MONEY</span></h2>

<p>With the inter-troop baseball series a thing
of the past, Sanson and Trexler promptly
turned their attention to swimming. They had
already been out to the lake several times, but with
baseball practise almost every day, it had not
been possible to spend very much time there.
Now, however, they both took advantage of every
free afternoon, and before a great while Paul
emerged from that first hopeless, helpless state
when it seemed as if he were never going to be
able even to support himself in the water. He was
still far from being a good swimmer, but at least
he could behold the miraculous ease and skill of
the other fellows without a feeling of despondent
envy.</p>

<p>Frank Sanson naturally made much quicker
progress. Knowing the rudiments, he did not, like
Paul, have to start at the very beginning. His
strength and endurance, too, were greater than
his friend&#8217;s, and he had practically none of Trexler&#8217;s
nervous timidity to combat. All he needed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
was practise, and he was not long graduating from
the novice class.</p>

<p>The latter was uncommonly large this year. It
was the first time the boys had had the freedom
of Crystal Lake, and practically every scout who
did not know how to swim seemed bent on learning
before the summer camp started. Many of
the enthusiasts went out there every afternoon,
while Saturdays always saw a big crowd, most of
whom brought their lunch and made a day of it.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, since swimming could not
very well be indulged in all the time, there developed
a great variety of scout sports and activities.
Often a scoutmaster or two showed up, and by
dint of a little suggestion would introduce among
the purely entertaining games one designed to test
the boys&#8217; ability at signaling or first aid, or his
knowledge of tracking and trailing and woodcraft
generally.</p>

<p>The system was entirely successful. Fellows
who lacked the ambition or push to acquire these
important details of scouting&#8211;and there are always
such in every troop&#8211;found themselves, to
their surprise, absorbing the knowledge through
the medium of a game or competition. More often
than not they discovered that it wasn&#8217;t so hard
or uninteresting as they supposed, and in many
cases real enthusiasm developed. Moreover,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
members of the different troops came to know and
understand each other in a way which would
have been impossible without this close and constant
companionship. Hitherto they had kept
pretty much to themselves, each boy traveling
mainly with his own crowd and generally meeting
the others as opponents on gridiron or diamond.</p>

<p>Now unexpected friendships developed. Paul
Trexler, who had revived much of his interest in
bird study, was amazed to find a kindred spirit in
Jim Crancher of Troop One. This big, rather
rough-and-ready, chap of whom Paul had always
stood somewhat in awe, proved to be quite as keen
as himself about birds and nature generally, and
the two had many a pleasant and profitable tramp
through the woods together. There were many
other similar cases, and before long it was no uncommon
thing to see boys who had hitherto been
rivals eating their lunch together and chatting intimately
about what they would do at camp.</p>

<p>The latter subject became more and more a topic
of interest and discussion. For the first time the
various troops were planning to join forces in a
common camp, and for months a committee of
scoutmasters had been at work on the details.
Funds for equipment had been secured by the local
council, but the question of a proper location
threatened to prove a serious difficulty. Dozens of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
sites had been investigated and found lacking in
some important particular, either in quantity or
quality of water, in woods not extensive enough
for hiking, and the like. Most of the really attractive
lakes in that part of the State were lined with
summer cottages and bungalows, while the wilder,
mountainous sections were too inaccessible to be
wisely considered in a camp of this nature.</p>

<p>The boys were beginning to grow seriously worried
when suddenly the rumor swept through town
that a novel and totally unexpected solution of the
difficulty had presented itself. It was said that
the committee had been offered the use of a large
tract of land in the southern part of the State
bordering on the ocean. Such a situation had
never been even remotely considered, and the excitement
of the boys, many of whom had never
seen the ocean, rose to fever-heat at the enthralling
possibility.</p>

<p>At the earliest possible moment Troop Five in a
body hurried around to obtain further details from
Mr. Curtis, only to discover that he had gone with
other members of the committee to look the ground
over. He was away for three days, returning the
afternoon of the troop meeting, from which, it is
perhaps needless to say, not a scout was absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard about it, I see,&#8221; the scoutmaster
remarked as he surveyed the line of eager, bright-eyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
boys before him. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that
we can employ our time better to-night than in
going over the camp proposition thoroughly and
finding out what you fellows think of the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it going to be at&#8211;at that place on the ocean,
sir?&#8221; put in one of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;ve practically decided to accept Mr.
Thornton&#8217;s offer. The distance was the only
drawback; it&#8217;s almost a hundred miles from here,
but I think we can get around that. Everything
else is ideal. The land is a wooded point of
six or seven hundred acres. One side faces the
ocean, the other a wide, sheltered bay that runs
inland several miles, joining finally with a small
river. The whole point is rather high ground,
with stretches of sand-dunes on the ocean side,
and wooded with scrub-oak and stunted pines.
Back of that, the land is mostly covered with second-growth
timber, and rises gradually to an elevation
called Lost Mine Hill&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, sir?&#8221; interrupted Court Parker,
eagerly.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster smiled. &#8220;At the time of the
Revolution there was said to be a copper-mine
located thereabouts, the entrance to which has
since been lost track of. At least, that&#8217;s what one
of the old residents told us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>More than one boy&#8217;s eyes sparkled. There was
a fascination in the mere name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s true or not, I have no idea,&#8221; continued
Mr. Curtis. &#8220;To return to the camp.
This would be located on the bay side of the point,
facing the village, which is over a mile distant and
practically the only settlement around. The
beach shelves gradually here, making an ideal
place for swimming, and there are three or four
small islands about a quarter of a mile from shore.
The fishing in the bay is fine, and there are lots
of crabs and eels in the coves and inlets farther up.
We should have to do a lot of clearing out, of
course, for the undergrowth is pretty thick, but
that would be more fun than otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long, concerted sigh went up from the listening
scouts. Ocean and islands and a lost copper-mine
seemed too entrancing a combination to be
possible. Several boys began to ask questions
at once, but stopped at a gesture from Mr. Curtis.</p>

<p>&#8220;One at a time, fellows,&#8221; he reminded them.
&#8220;The only practicable way of getting there, Bob,
is to hire an auto-truck and motor down to Clam
Cove, crossing over in a motor-boat. We haven&#8217;t
enough tents or equipment to accommodate all the
fellows at once, so we&#8217;ve decided to divide in two
or three relays of say thirty-five boys to a group,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
each crowd to stay two weeks. The truck could
make the trip in seven or eight hours, and by
starting early could take one bunch down and
bring another back the same day, thus considerably
lessening the expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you think that will be, sir?&#8221;
asked Dale Tompkins, quickly, an anxious wrinkle
in his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;About five dollars a week for board and a dollar
extra for transportation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The troubled expression deepened in Dale&#8217;s face,
and he scarcely heard the various other questions
and answers that followed. Six dollars a week&#8211;twelve
in all! There would be other necessities,
too, in the way of clothes fit for camp. He had no
shorts, for instance, or decent sneakers. Fifteen
dollars would barely cover the outlay; and though
he had worked hard for two months at least, he
had little more than half of the amount saved.
Where was the rest to come from?</p>

<p>When Mr. Curtis, with pencil and paper in hand,
started at the head of the line to note down what
boys were going, Tompkins roused himself and
listened with a touch of envy to the ready answers:
&#8220;Yes, <i>sir</i>!&#8221; &#8220;You can count me in every time,
sir!&#8221; &#8220;Can&#8217;t a fellow stay longer than two
weeks?&#8221; or, from Larry Wilks, &#8220;No, sir; I&#8217;m
going up to Maine as soon as school is over.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
Not one of them seemed troubled by the problem
which worried him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Dale?&#8221; asked the scoutmaster,
after jotting down Vedder&#8217;s prompt acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;don&#8217;t know, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble? Want to talk it over at
home?&#8221; said the scoutmaster, dropping his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-o, sir. They&#8217;ll let me go all right,&#8221; answered
Dale, adding, in a still lower tone, &#8220;only I&#8211;I&#8217;m
not sure about the&#8211;money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis nodded understandingly. &#8220;I see.
Well, there will be at least two weeks before even
the first crowd goes. We&#8217;ll have to get together
and think up ways and means.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed on, leaving Dale not very greatly encouraged.
It would be like Mr. Curtis to invent
some work about his place whereby the scout might
earn the required amount, but Dale was determined
to stay at home rather than take advantage
of the scoutmaster in that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done enough for me already,&#8221; the boy
said to himself with a stubborn squaring of the
jaws. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t raise the funds some other way,
I&#8217;ll just have to go without camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night he lay long awake, trying to think
of some possible method, but his efforts were not
very successful. He still had his paper-route, but
the money from that went mostly into the family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
treasury. He might, and probably would, get
some odd jobs during the next two weeks, but
there was only grass cutting, now, or weeding
gardens, and neither of these chores was particularly
well paid in Hillsgrove.</p>

<p>On the whole the outlook was distinctly discouraging,
and for the next few days Dale had a
struggle to maintain his usual cheerfulness. For
months he had looked forward to camp as the
supreme culmination of a more than usually happy
year.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem as if I <i>could</i> give it up!&#8221; he
muttered rebelliously at the end of a day which
had brought him just twenty cents for a laborious
weeding job. &#8220;Oh, gee! If I&#8217;d only started to
save for it sooner, I&#8211;&#8221; He broke off and bit his
lips. Presently a crooked smile struggled defiantly
through the gloom. &#8220;Oh, thunder!&#8221; he
exclaimed whimsically. &#8220;Quit your grouching,
Dale Tompkins. If you&#8217;re going to let a little
matter like earning ten dollars stand between you
and a corking good time, you&#8217;re no kind of a scout
at all.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ACCIDENT</span></h2>

<p>It was on Thursday morning that Mr. Curtis
sent for Dale, and in spite of his suspicions the
boy brightened a little as he entered the scoutmaster&#8217;s
study and noticed the smile on the latter&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dale,&#8221; began Mr. Curtis, cheerily, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been puzzling my brains over that problem of
yours ever since Monday night, and yesterday the
answer was fairly thrust on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy pricked up his ears doubtfully. &#8220;What
is it, sir?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bird-houses. You&#8217;re our prize carpenter, and
I know you made a number of them in the spring.
Now&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bird-houses!&#8221; interrupted the boy, incredulously.
&#8220;Bird-houses at the end of June! Why,
who&#8211;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re making&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, biting his lips. Mr. Curtis
did not seem offended. In fact, he merely
chuckled and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
nothing at all to do with it. I had an inquiry this
morning from some one who&#8211;a&#8211;probably knows
it&#8217;s a scout specialty for a quotation on a number
of rather elaborate houses that are wanted at
once. There&#8217;s the list.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dazedly Dale took the paper and stared at it.
It was a type-written list describing, with some
detail, the eight bird-houses desired. Two of
them, for martin colonies, called for something
large and rather elaborate. All were distinctly of
a more expensive class than was usually in demand.
Even without figuring, he could see that
his time alone, were it possible to finish the work
inside of two weeks, would be worth over ten dollars.
In spite of his doubts, his eyes brightened
as he looked up at the scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a corking order!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It
would put me all to the good. But I can&#8217;t understand
why anybody would want bird-houses after
the birds have all nested for the season. Who are
they for, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; returned Mr. Curtis.
&#8220;Now don&#8217;t go off at half-cock,&#8221; he added quickly,
as Dale&#8217;s lips parted impulsively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you
I had nothing to do with it in any way. The inquiry
this morning was as much of a surprise to
me as it is to you, but just because the person
doesn&#8217;t wish to be known is no reason why you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
should balk at the offer. There may be any number
of reasons. At least there&#8217;s no touch of
charity about it. You&#8217;ll be giving full value received,
won&#8217;t you? And you certainly build better
houses than any other boy in the troop.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a second Dale hesitated, torn between a last
lingering doubt and a natural eagerness to snatch
at this wonderful opportunity. &#8220;You mean you&#8211;advise
me to accept?&#8221; he asked slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I see no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t treat
it as a regular business proposition and make out
your estimate at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale hesitated no longer. The whole thing still
seemed odd, but after all, as Mr. Curtis had said,
he had nothing to do with that. He was still further
reassured when he went over the specifications
again, seated at a corner of the scoutmaster&#8217;s
writing-table. The very detail with which these
had been made out pointed to a distinct and definite
want, not to a charity meant to give work to
an unknown scout.</p>

<p>For two hours the boy sat making rough plans,
measuring, figuring, and calculating with the utmost
care. He conscientiously put his estimate as
low as he possibly could, and when word came next
day to go ahead he plunged into the work blithely,
determined to give the unknown good value for
his money.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>Fortunately, school was over and Dale could
give practically all his time to the undertaking.
He took a chance and registered for the first two
weeks at camp, but it was a close call, and the
houses were delivered to Mr. Curtis only the very
morning before the party was scheduled to start.
That afternoon he had the money, and there was
no happier boy in Hillsgrove as he hastily sought
the scout store at the Y. M. C. A. and made his
necessary purchases.</p>

<p>It was at the same place that the crowd gathered
with bag and baggage next morning at six o&#8217;clock.
Early as it was, the majority were on hand before
the appointed hour, so there was no delay in getting
off. Seats had been built along each side of
the big motor-truck, and the moment suitcases and
duffle-bags were stowed away beneath them, there
was a scramble to get aboard.</p>

<p>Tompkins found himself presently squeezed in
near the rear, next to Court Parker, with Sanson,
Bob Gibson, and Paul Trexler near by. Most of
the older fellows were farther front, and Mr. Curtis
sat next to the driver. It was a perfect day,
clear, sparkling, cloudless, and as the truck rumbled
out of Hillsgrove and started southward
along the fine state road the boys were in high
spirits. Soon some one started up a song, and
from one familiar air they passed to another, letting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
off a good deal of steam in that fashion. A
lot more was got rid of by practising troop yells,
and when the truck began to pass between fields of
waving yellow grain, they found amusement in
seeing how many of the laboring farmers would
answer their shouts and hand-wavings.</p>

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t possible, of course, to keep up this
sort of thing for the entire journey, and after a
couple of hours they settled down to a quieter key.
Naturally, the most interesting subject of discussion
was the camp, and presently, in response to
a number of requests, Mr. Curtis moved back to
the middle of the truck to tell the crowd, that included
many boys from other troops, all he knew
about it. When he had described in detail the situation
and its advantages and explained the arrangement
of the camp which three other scoutmasters
and a number of the other boys had gone
down ahead to lay out, he paused for a moment or
two.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing, fellows,&#8221; he went on
presently &#8220;that we&#8217;ve got to be mighty careful
about. The land is owned by John Thornton, the
banker, whose wonderful country-place, twenty
miles this side of Clam Cove, you may have heard
about. It seems that he&#8217;s had a great deal of
trouble with boys trespassing, starting fires in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
woods, injuring the shrubbery and rare trees, and
even trapping game. It&#8217;s possible, of course,
though I should hate to believe it, that some of this
damage has been done by scouts, as he seems to
think. At all events, he is very much opposed to
the movement, which he contends merely gives
boys a certain freedom and authority to roam the
woods,&#8211;building fires, cutting trees, and having a
thoughtless good time generally,&#8211;without teaching
them anything of real value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; sniffed Sherman Ward, indignantly.
&#8220;Then why has he offered us this camping-site?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t offered it to us as scouts. He&#8217;s
loaned it to Captain Chalmers, who is a very close
friend, and he as much as says that our behavior
there will merely prove his point about the uselessness
of scouting. Of course, he&#8217;s dead wrong,
but he&#8217;s a mighty hard man to convince, and we&#8217;ll
have to toe the mark all the time. I don&#8217;t mean
it&#8217;s going to interfere with our having all the fun
that&#8217;s going, but we&#8217;ll have to take a little more
pains than usual to have a model camp. There
mustn&#8217;t be any careless throwing about of rubbish.
In getting fire-wood we&#8217;ll have to put into
practice all we&#8217;ve learned about the right sort of
forestry. When away from camp on hikes or for
any other purpose, we must always conduct ourselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
as good scouts and remember that it&#8217;s not
only our own reputation we&#8217;re upholding, but that
of the whole order.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had gone back to his place in front
there were a few indignant comments on Mr.
Thornton and his point of view, but for the most
part the boys took it sensibly, with many a determined
tightening of the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he won&#8217;t get anything on us,&#8221; commented
Ted MacIlvaine, decidedly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
rather fun, fellows, making him back down.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an emphatic chorus of agreement, but
little further discussion, for the question of lunch
was beginning to be pressing. Though barely
eleven, boxes and haversacks were produced and
the next half-hour enlivened with one of the most
satisfying of occupations. Toward noon they
stopped at a small town for &#8220;gas.&#8221; When the
car started on again, there was a pleasant sense
of excitement in the realization that another couple
of hours ought to bring them to Clam Cove.</p>

<p>The country had changed greatly from that
around Hillsgrove. It looked wilder, more unsettled.
Instead of fields of ripening grain, orchards,
or acres of truck-gardens, the road was
bordered by long stretches of woods and tangled
undergrowth. The farm-houses were farther
apart and less pretentious. There was even a
faint tang of salt in the air. At length, from the
summit of an elevation, Mr. Curtis pointed out a
distant hill showing hazily blue on the horizon.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i5'></a><img src='images/illus5.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
The car crashed into the weather-worn railing of the bridge
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s Lost Mine Hill, fellows!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;From there, it&#8217;s not more than three miles to our
stopping-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eagerly they stared and speculated as the truck
clattered down the incline, its horn sounding raucously.
At the bottom there was a straight level
stretch of a thousand feet or so, with a bridge midway
along it. It was sandy here in the hollow,
and the truck had made little more than half the
distance to the bridge when all at once, with a
weird wailing of the siren, a great gray car shot
into sight around a curve beyond.</p>

<p>It was going very fast. Dale and Court, hanging
over the side of the truck together, had barely
time to note the trim chauffeur behind the wheel
and a man and woman in the luxurious tonneau
when the explosion of a blow-out, sharp as a pistol-shot,
smote on their startled senses. The car
leaped, quivered, skidded in the loose sand,
crashed into the weather-worn railing of the
bridge, hung suspended for an instant above the
stream, and then toppled over and out of sight.
There was a tremendous splash, a great spurt of
flying water, and then&#8211;silence!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>FIRST AID</span></h2>

<p>Dale never knew just how he got out of the
truck. Gripped by the horror and suddenness
of the accident, his mind was a blank until he
found himself running over the bridge amid a
throng of other hurrying scouts. A moment later
he was pressed close to the unbroken portion of
the railing, and, staring down, caught a glimpse
of the gray car upturned in the sluggish waters of
the stream.</p>

<p>The car had turned turtle, and the great wheels,
still spinning slowly, showed above the surface
almost to their hubs. The water was roiled and
muddy; bubbles and a little steam rose about the
forward part of the car. Ten feet away floated a
chauffeur&#8217;s cap. Nearer at hand, a light lap-robe,
billowed by the air caught underneath, seemed for
an instant to be the clothing of one of the passengers.
But Dale swiftly understood its real nature,
and with a choke he realized that the people were
pinned beneath the car. All this came to him in
a flash; then, as Mr. Curtis and the foremost of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
the scouts plunged down into the wide, but shallow,
stream, he turned suddenly about and raced back
to the truck.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the sick sense of horror that moved
him. All at once he had remembered the troop
first-aid kit, which he himself had carefully
stowed away under one of the long seats. They
would need it badly, and he did not think any of
the others had stopped to get it. There would
be plenty of them without him to lift the car.</p>

<p>Panting to the side of the deserted truck, Dale
leaped into the back, and, dropping to his knees,
tore and dug among the close-packed baggage like
a terrier seeking rats. Swiftly he unearthed the
square, japanned case and dragged it forth.
When he reached the bridge again, the scene had
altogether changed. Waist-deep in the water, a
line of scouts was holding up the heavy car, whose
weight was testified to by their straining muscles
and tense attitudes. Already the two passengers
had been dragged forth. The one whom at first
they had taken to be a woman had been carried to
the bank, and Dale saw, with a throb of pity, that
she was a girl of not more than fifteen. Two
scouts supported the limp figure of the man, and
as Dale ran around the end of the bridge and down
the bank a shout from Sherman Ward announced
the discovery of the chauffeur.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;Get him out quickly!&#8221; tersely ordered Mr.
Curtis. &#8220;You and Crancher look after him; you
know what to do. Bob and Ranny see to the girl!
I&#8217;ll take care of this man. Court, hustle for the
first-aid kit; it&#8217;s under&#8211; Oh, you&#8217;ve got it!
Good boy, Dale. Open it upon the bank and get
out the ammonia. Then be ready with some bandages
when I call for them. Frank, take one or
two fellows and bring six or eight blankets here
from the truck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the cool, dominating influence of the
scoutmaster the situation speedily resolved itself
into one of orderly method. The three patients
were stretched out on blankets on the bank,
and only those scouts actively interested in bringing
them around were allowed in the vicinity.
The others went back to the car and busied
themselves with trying to right it&#8211;a rather futile
undertaking, but it kept them out of the
way.</p>

<p>The girl was the first to respond to treatment,
but the older man opened his eyes not long afterward.
While both were dazed by the shock, they
seemed to have escaped with no more serious injuries
than bruises. The chauffeur, however, was
badly cut about the face and head, and Mr. Curtis
himself superintended the work of Ward and
Crancher in tying up and bandaging. When this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
was over he turned back to the other man, who was
trying to get on his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better lie quietly for a bit
longer?&#8221; he asked quickly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been rather
badly shaken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Robert&#8211;all right?&#8221; asked the other, briefly,
as he dropped back to the ground again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically. He&#8217;s cut about the head, but
we&#8217;ve bandaged him up, and I think he&#8217;ll be all
right until we can get him to a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s puzzled gaze wandered to the little
group of scouts standing well to one side and
then returned to Mr. Curtis&#8217;s face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
how you came to be on the spot so
promptly,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Who&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Curtis,&#8221; explained the scoutmaster,
as the other paused. &#8220;I&#8217;m taking a party of
scouts from Hillsgrove down to camp on Great
Bay. Our truck wasn&#8217;t a hundred feet away
when you skidded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scouts!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Boy Scouts?&#8221;
Again his glance swept the circle, taking in this
time the prone figure of the chauffeur, whose head,
swathed in workmanlike bandages, rested against
a thin roll of blanket. &#8220;I understand,&#8221; he went
on briefly. &#8220;I am very greatly indebted to you,
Mr. Curtis. May I trouble you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>He extended his hand, and this time the scoutmaster
did not hesitate to help him up. Together
the two assisted the girl to her feet, and Mr. Curtis
reached for a blanket, placing it carefully around
her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she murmured shyly. She had
recovered from her fright, and seemed none the
worse for the accident. &#8220;Dad, if we could only
get a car or something to take us home,&#8221; she said
pluckily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our truck isn&#8217;t exactly comfortable,&#8221; suggested
Mr. Curtis, &#8220;but I fancy it would be the
quickest way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly!&#8221; agreed the man. &#8220;The nearest
house is two miles off, and my own place isn&#8217;t
more than double that. But wouldn&#8217;t it be inconveniencing
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit! We have plenty of time; and anyway,
your man ought to have a doctor&#8217;s attention
as soon as possible. The boys can wait here till
the truck comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further delay he motioned Ward and
Crancher to help the chauffeur and led the way to
the truck. Full of interest and curiosity, the
others watched them take their places, saw the
engine started, and remained staring after the
lumbering vehicle until it had passed out of sight
around the curve. Then began an eager discussion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
of the whole affair, until finally some one suggested
building a fire and drying out their wet
clothes. The latter process was still going on
when the truck returned, after nearly an hour&#8217;s
absence, and Mr. Curtis leaped out. As he came
up to the group he was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it, sir?&#8221; called several of the scouts
at once. &#8220;Did you find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221; The scoutmaster&#8217;s smile deepened a
little. &#8220;You can have three guesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s puzzled silence; then,
&#8220;Mr. Thornton?&#8221; hazarded Court Parker, flippantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; laughed Mr. Curtis; &#8220;only his
brother and niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parker gasped in surprise; so did several others.
Then a shout went up, and a volley of questions
was poured at the scoutmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you meet Mr. Thornton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he still think scouting isn&#8217;t any good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He failed to say,&#8221; returned Mr. Curtis, his
eyes twinkling. &#8220;I hoped, of course, that he&#8217;d
fall on my neck and declare he was all wrong and
that scouting was the most wonderful thing in
the world. But apparently he isn&#8217;t that sort.
There&#8217;s no question, though, that he was favorably
impressed, and with this good beginning I
trust we can bring him around before camp is over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
Pile in now, fellows. We&#8217;re late already and
mustn&#8217;t waste any more time.&#8221;</p>

<p>About an hour afterward they rumbled over a
bridge, ran along a rather sluggish stream for a
quarter of a mile or so, and then entered the little
village of Clam Cove, where they found Captain
Chalmers and Mr. Knox, one of the scoutmasters,
somewhat impatiently awaiting them. Full of excitement,
the boys piled out, gathered up their luggage,
and made tracks for the two motor-boats tied
to the end of the dock. There was the usual bustle
and turmoil of embarking, but no delay, for every
one was too anxious to see the camp to waste any
time stowing himself away. In ten minutes the
entire crowd was disposed of and the ropes cast
off.</p>

<p>The bay was over a mile wide at this point. Its
waters, stirred into ripples by the freshening
breeze, glinted in the rays of the afternoon sun.
Against the dark green of the farther shore a
string of little islands showed and started a buzz
of eager comment and question. About half-way
across, the camp itself came suddenly into sight, a
trim row of glistening white tents outlined against
a background of fir and cedar, which brought
forth a shout of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Don&#8217;t it look great? I can hardly believe
we&#8217;re here, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>But there could be no question of the reality of
it all as they tumbled into the trailers and went
ashore in relays. It was a rather small point, jutting
out from the larger one into the comparatively
quiet waters of the bay. For some distance
back the undergrowth had been cleared
away, but clumps of bushy cedars and glossy-leaved
holly remained to give shade and diversity.
Six wall-tents, each with a wooden floor and bunks
to accommodate eight boys, were pitched on two
sides of a square, at the corner of which stood a
larger tent known as headquarters. Here dwelt
the governing powers, in the shape of the commissioner
and the three scoutmasters, and in front of
it, on a rustic pole fluttered the Stars and Stripes.
Across the square, among the trees, was a large
dining-tent, and behind that a substantial frame
cook-shack.</p>

<p>To the new arrivals, hot and dusty from their
long ride, it all looked tremendously cool and inviting,
and there was a rush to shed uniforms and
get into shorts and undershirts. Dale Tompkins
found himself placed in a tent with Court
Parker, Sanson, Bob Gibson, Trexler, Vedder and
Bennie Rhead, with Ranleigh Phelps as leader.
The latter&#8217;s presence rather surprised him. He
supposed Ranny would want to be with Torrance
and Slater, two of his closest chums. Later,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
learning that Wesley Becker was tent-leader with
that crowd, he decided that the arrangement was
due to the camp heads rather than to Ranny&#8217;s personal
preference.</p>

<p>But no matter what the cause, Tompkins was
distinctly glad of the other&#8217;s presence. Though
he tried not to build any hopes on what might be
merely the result of his own imagination, Dale had
a feeling that the fellow he admired and liked in
spite of himself hadn&#8217;t been quite so distant
lately. Besides, offish or not, just having Ranny
in the same tent seemed, curiously, to bring him
nearer, and Dale settled himself in the opposite
bunk with an odd thrill of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Long before the hour for the afternoon swim the
fellows were in their bathing togs, impatiently
awaiting the signal. When it came, there was a
regular stampede down to the beach, and in the
space of thirty seconds every scout, save only
three of the advance-party, who had been appointed
life-savers, was splashing joyously in the
water. They enjoyed every minute of that half-hour,
and responded to the dressing signal with a
reluctance that was considerably tempered by Mr.
Reed&#8217;s announcement of an early supper.</p>

<p>There was no council-fire that night. The
crowd that had come down was too sleepy to do
more than listen to a brief talk by Captain Chalmers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
in front of headquarters tent, in which he repeated
what Mr. Curtis had told them of the need
of refuting Mr. Thornton&#8217;s peculiar ideas on
scouting and briefly explained the camp rules and
routine.</p>

<p>Each of the six tents, which were numbered, was
to be daily assigned to special duty such as sanitary
squad, cook&#8217;s helpers, commissary, and the
like. In addition there would be a daily tent-inspection,
and before each meal an inspection of the
tables, which corresponded to the tents in number
and for which the boys occupying those tents were
responsible. All of these marks would be carefully
kept, and the tent having the highest at the
end of each week would be the honor tent, to be
accorded special privileges besides having its individual
marks go toward the winning of a camp
emblem. This emblem, the captain explained,
would be the highest honor a scout could obtain in
camp, and when he had finished, almost every one
of his hearers was keenly determined to carry the
coveted trophy back to Hillsgrove on the front of
his jersey.</p>

<p>It was barely dark when the talk was over, but
already more than one tired scout was nodding
and the clear notes of taps sent them stumbling
tentward. Dale Tompkins lost not a moment in
shedding his clothes and crawling in between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
blankets. He heard vaguely the complaining
tones of Harry Vedder as he climbed into an upper
bunk, and the joshing comment of those who
watched the diverting process. But even these
sounds barely penetrated to his brain. In a
moment more he was lost to the world, and in his
next conscious moment he was opening his eyes
to the dawn of another day.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>LOST MINE HILL</span></h2>

<p>The camp was very still. Each tree and bush
stood motionless and distinct in the queer
gray light of early morning. Their tent was the
last in the row, and lying on his side, Dale could
look under the rolled-up flap straight across the
sloping, sandy beach, over the smooth, rhythmic
lapping water of the bay to the low, sparsely
wooded line beyond which lay the sea. There was
a crisp tang to the air that made him snuggle into
his blankets as he drowsily watched the eastern
sky turn pink and gold and delicately crimson in
the glory of the rising sun.</p>

<p>The boy gave a sigh of content, and his lids
drooped sleepily. The next thing he knew reveille
was sounding, and he rolled over to meet the
glance of Ranny Phelps, sitting tousle-headed on
the edge of the opposite bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Isn&#8217;t this great!&#8221; exclaimed Tompkins,
impulsively.</p>

<p>Ranny nodded. &#8220;It sure is!&#8221; he agreed, in a
half-friendly, half-embarrassed fashion. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
then, almost as if regretting his tone, he sprang
up and reached for his swimming-tights.
&#8220;Everybody out for the morning dip, fellows,&#8221; he
called authoritatively.</p>

<p>They needed no urging. Vedder was the only
one who clung to his blankets, and the others lost
no time in dragging these off and applying the sole
of a sneaker with a dexterity that brought a howl
of protest from the plump youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! Quit that!&#8221; he roared, rolling over
the side of the bunk and thudding to the floor.
&#8220;Wait till I get hold of you, Court Parker, and
I&#8217;ll&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The threat ended in a sputter as the rest fled,
giggling, to gather before headquarters for the
brief ceremony of flag-raising. Then followed
five minutes of setting-up exercises that sent the
blood tingling through their veins and made them
more than ever eager for the refreshing plunge,
after which came dressing, the airing of blankets,
and breakfast&#8211;and the day&#8217;s work and pleasure
had fairly begun.</p>

<p>It was mostly work that first morning. Dale&#8217;s
tent had pioneering duties, and for two hours or
more he sweated with ax and grub-hoe, clearing
out more undergrowth and making the camp shipshape.
Ranny was no easy taskmaster. He kept
everybody hustling without any let-up, and half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
an hour before inspection he had the whole seven
hard at work on the tent, sweeping, folding blankets,
and tidying up generally. There were a few
grumbling asides, but the credit they received at
the inspection silenced all that and made each boy
resolved to be just as thorough every day. It
wasn&#8217;t so bad, after all, most of them decided.
Certainly they enjoyed their swim twice as much
for the knowledge that the longest part of the day
lay before them, unburdened by a single duty.</p>

<p>Both before and during dinner, there was a
good deal of speculation as to what had been
planned for the afternoon. But this was not revealed
until the last spoonful of dessert had been
consumed, when Mr. Reed arose from his place at
the officers&#8217; table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of you fellows have heard of Lost Mine
Hill,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and are probably wanting to get
a closer view of it. There&#8217;s a legend, you know,
that before the Revolution there were copper
workings in the neighborhood which were long ago
abandoned and the entrance to the shafts, or whatever
they were, lost track of. This afternoon
we&#8217;ll take a hike over there and see if a little systematic
scouting can&#8217;t solve the mystery. To
make it more interesting, we&#8217;ll consider it a sort
of competition on the treasure-hunt idea, each tent
working together as a unit against the other five.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
If the entrance should happen to be located, the
crowd that finds it will be given a certain number
of credits toward the emblem. Everybody be on
hand at headquarters at one sharp, for we don&#8217;t
want to waste any time starting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea met with instant approval, and the
burst of eager talk that followed showed how thoroughly
it had stirred the boys&#8217; imaginations. For
the next twenty minutes the camp buzzed with interested
discussion, and at one o&#8217;clock not a scout
was missing from the throng before headquarters
tent.</p>

<p>They started at once, with Mr. Reed and Mr.
Curtis in the lead. There were no regular roads
to follow, but after half an hour&#8217;s tramp through
the woods they struck an overgrown track, and
kept to it until it simply dwindled away into nothing
and disappeared. A little distance beyond,
the ground began to rise, gradually at first, but
with increasing steepness, while outcroppings of
rock showed more and more frequently. Presently,
reaching a small open place among the
trees, the scoutmasters paused and waited for the
stragglers to come up.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well start the hunt here, fellows,&#8221;
said Mr. Reed, taking out his watch. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
make any suggestions as to how to go about it;
each tent-leader must think that out for himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
Use your heads, that&#8217;s all, and don&#8217;t get too far
away to be back here at four-thirty sharp. It&#8217;s
taken us over an hour to make this point, so we
ought to start back then at the latest. Remember,
a little blazing will make the return trip easier,
and if nobody finds anything to-day, we&#8217;ll take it
up later in the week. Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had been standing in little groups
about him, and at the signal most of these started
off hotfoot, as if they expected to gain their end by
speed alone. Some hurried on toward the summit
of the hill; others turned to right or left and, pushing
through the undergrowth, disappeared along
the side of the slope. Somewhat to Tompkins&#8217;s
surprise, Ranny Phelps dawdled along until the
others were out of sight. Then, however, he
turned swiftly and led the way almost directly
downhill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going back for?&#8221; asked Court
Parker, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a hunch,&#8221; returned Ranny, briefly.
Though instantly besieged with questions, he did
not continue until they were well away from the
clearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just this,&#8221; he said, without moderating
his brisk pace. &#8220;We certainly can&#8217;t expect to find
something that even the natives have lost track of,
by just tramping around aimlessly. Of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
we might happen to stumble on it, but that would
be a thousand-to-one chance. The best way is to
use system. Did any of you notice the old fellow
who brought over a load of fish this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man with whiskers you were talking to at
the cook-shack?&#8221; asked Frank Sanson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Well, he&#8217;s lived around here all his life
and is quite a character. I was asking him about
this lost mine just out of curiosity and without
having heard anything about the stunt this afternoon.
He didn&#8217;t know much, but he finally did
say his grandfather had once told him of an old
building they used as a smelter, or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; exclaimed Sanson, excitedly. &#8220;And is
this the way to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t any idea. He&#8217;d never seen it himself,
and of course it must have gone to ruin ages
ago. But it stands to reason, doesn&#8217;t it, that a
smelter would be more on the level and not on the
side of a hill like this? They&#8217;d have to cart stuff
to and from it along some kind of a road&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one we came along!&#8221; put in Parker,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, though no road would keep open all
this time without cutting. Very likely that&#8217;s just
a lumbering-track. The point is, if we can only
locate this building, we&#8217;ll be somewhere near the
mine and won&#8217;t have to go prospecting all over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
map. So that&#8217;s what we want to look for&#8211;a
foundation of any kind or the least sign of a building.
As soon as we&#8217;re down a bit farther we&#8217;ll
spread out and hunt systematically. It may be
clear on the other side of the hill, but at least we&#8217;ll
have something definite to look for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s on this side,&#8221; said Dale Tompkins,
suddenly. &#8220;In the old days they didn&#8217;t have
many roads and did most of their traveling by
water, so I should think&#8211; Oh, shucks! I forgot
the smelter would be near the mine and that might
be anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might,&#8221; agreed Ranny; &#8220;but it won&#8217;t do
any harm to try this side first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Full of enthusiasm, they hurried down the slope,
and when the steepest part was over they spread
out in a line about twenty feet apart. In this formation
they moved forward, keeping a sharp lookout
for the slightest sign that might help them in
the search.</p>

<p>They moved slowly forward through the forest,
the fascination of the hunt gripping them more
and more strongly. The sense of emulation, always
keen with a crowd of boys, was intensified by
the belief that, thanks to Ranny, they had just a
little better chance of success than any of the
others. The object of their search, too, stirred
the imagination. There was a glamour of mystery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
about it which placed the whole thing in a different
class from the games that they ordinarily
played.</p>

<p>But little by little, as they found only the same
monotonous succession of rocks and trees and
tangled undergrowth, Dale&#8217;s mind began to dwell
on the growing probability that they might not find
the mine after all. Over an hour of close search
had failed to reveal any trace of the ruined
smelter. The ground on the river side of the hill
had been thoroughly gone over, and they were now
making their way inland, keeping well in toward
the slope, and even spreading out a little on it.
Without actually running into any of the other
searching-parties, they had twice heard voices
farther up the hill. The second time, in fact, these
were so near that Dale could distinguish the familiar
tones of Wesley Becker, and it was while
peering curiously through the trees in that direction
that he tripped over an obstruction and fell
headlong, bruising his shin and twisting one wrist
painfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to look out for those feet of yours,
Tommy,&#8221; laughed Frank Sanson, from the right.
&#8220;They&#8217;re awful things to trip over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Usually quick enough with a retort, Tompkins
made no answer. He had scrambled up and stood
clutching his aching wrist instinctively. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
neither his gaze nor his attention was on the injured
member. Flushed, bright-eyed, he was staring
eagerly at the obstacle that had caused his
tumble.</p>

<p>It was nothing more than a line of stones, barely
showing above the decaying vegetation of the forest
floor. But the boy&#8217;s swift vision had already
taken in the fact that the line was straight and
true, and that the stones were held together by
crumbling remains of mortar.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AROUND THE COUNCIL FIRE</span></h2>

<p>Dale&#8217;s first impulse was to summon the others
with a jubilant shout. His lips parted
swiftly, but closed again as he remembered the
nearness of Wes Becker&#8217;s crowd. It would never
do to let them suspect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank!&#8221; he called in a low tone. &#8220;Come over
here&#8211;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sanson responded instantly &#8220;Found anything?&#8221;
he demanded, as he plunged through the
bushes. Then his eyes fell on the line of ruined
masonry and he caught his breath. &#8220;Gee!&#8221; he
exclaimed delightedly. &#8220;That certainly looks
like&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-h!&#8221; cautioned Tompkins. &#8220;Wes and his
bunch are not far off&#8211;right up the hill: we
mustn&#8217;t put them wise, or they&#8217;ll all come piling
down here. You get Ranny and Court, and I&#8217;ll
tell the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>They quickly separated, and in less than three
minutes the others had hastened to the spot. As
he took in the bit of old wall Ranny Phelps&#8217; eyes
brightened and he looked at Tompkins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve hit it, old man,&#8221; he said
warmly. &#8220;There&#8217;d hardly be any other foundation
in this jungle. Let&#8217;s scrape away the
leaves and mold a little and see if we can&#8217;t find a
corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eagerly they fell to work, and before long had
uncovered two sides of a rough stone rectangle,
some eighteen by thirty feet, and even unearthed
the ends of a couple of tough, hand-hewn oak
beams which had fallen in and become covered
with dead leaves and other debris. About the
middle of one side was a solid, square mass of
stone that looked as if it might have been the base
of a forge or smelting-furnace. But there was no
chance to proceed further, for Ranny suddenly
jerked out his watch and gave an exclamation of
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh! Almost four o&#8217;clock. We&#8217;ve got to
start back right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw&#8211;gee! Let&#8217;s take just a few minutes
more,&#8221; begged several voices at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; returned Ranny, decidedly.
&#8220;If we&#8217;re not back at four-thirty, they&#8217;ll think
we&#8217;ve found something, and we don&#8217;t want that.
We&#8217;ve got something definite to start from next
time; and if we keep it to ourselves, we&#8217;ll have a
fine and dandy chance of putting it over on the rest
of the camp. Everybody get busy and hustle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
some leaves and stuff over the wall so nobody
else&#8217;ll stumble on it by accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a very short time practically all traces of
their explorations had been covered over, and the
fellows started back at a brisk pace. They were
able to return much more quickly than they had
come out, and reached the meeting-place in good
season to find, with not a little secret satisfaction,
that none of the other parties had met with success.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you fellows mustn&#8217;t let that discourage
you,&#8221; said Mr. Reed, briskly. &#8220;As I told you before,
you can&#8217;t expect to locate in an hour or so
something that&#8217;s been lost for nearly a hundred
years. We&#8217;ll try it again about Saturday,
and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, Mr. Reed,&#8221; piped up Bennie, eagerly,
&#8220;can&#8217;t we come back to-morrow and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off with some abruptness as Ranny&#8217;s
fingers closed over his shoulder in a warning grip.
The scoutmaster laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it bad, Bennie,&#8221; he smiled.
&#8220;Were you getting warm just when you had to
stop? You&#8217;ll have to practise patience, I&#8217;m
afraid. To-morrow we&#8217;re going up the river for
crabs, and on Friday afternoon there&#8217;ll be an
athletic meet. Don&#8217;t worry, though. The mine
isn&#8217;t going to run away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>&#8220;You chump!&#8221; whispered Phelps in the small
boy&#8217;s ear as they started off downhill in a body.
&#8220;Do you want to give the whole show away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean anything, Ranny&#8211;honest. I
didn&#8217;t think&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say you didn&#8217;t!&#8221; Ranny&#8217;s tone was
severe, but his face relaxed a bit at the other&#8217;s
comical expression of dismay. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let another
peep like that out of you or we&#8217;ll have some of
the crowd trailing us next time we come here.
I&#8217;ll be surprised if Wes or somebody hasn&#8217;t
caught on already.&#8221;</p>

<p>But apparently no one had. Doubtless they
laid Bennie&#8217;s outburst to the irresponsibility of
extreme youth and ignored it. On the way back
to camp there was a good deal of general discussion
and theorizing about the location of the mine,
but the members of Tent Three managed their
answers well enough, apparently, to prevent suspicion.
After supper, too, the interest shifted to
the morrow&#8217;s doings, and by the time the call for
council-fire sounded through the dusk Lost Mine
had been momentarily forgotten.</p>

<p>Out on the extreme tip of Long Point a great
heap of branches and driftwood had been assembled,
and around this the scouts gathered in a wide
circle. Some sat cross-legged, draped in blankets,
for the air was brisk and cool. Others sprawled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
at length upon the soft sand, shoulder pressing
shoulder, arms flung carelessly about one another&#8217;s
neck. Overhead the sky was brilliant with
stars. From all about came the soft lapping of
water, mingled with the lulling, rhythmic beat of
surf upon the distant shore. It was a moment of
complete relaxation after a long and strenuous
day, and from many lips there breathed sighs of
utter contentment.</p>

<p>And then the flames, creeping from a little pile
of timber at the bottom of the heap, licked up
through the dead branches to flare out at the top&#8211;a
great yellow beacon that chased away the
shadows and brought into clear relief the circle
of eager, boyish faces. From where the officers
sat came presently the soft chords of Captain
Chalmers&#8217;s guitar mingled with the sweeter,
higher tinkle of Mr. Reed&#8217;s mandolin, feeling their
way from simple harmonies into the stirring
melody of an old, familiar song. Of course the
fellows caught it up, singing lustily to the last
note, and their clear young voices, wafting out
across the water, reached the ears of a grizzled
fisherman coming in with the tide and carried
him in a twinkling back fifty years or more into
the long-forgotten past.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SURPRISE FOR VEDDER</span></h2>

<p>It was a distinctly informal council-fire.
There were no special stunts or games or
competitions, as there would be later; merely
songs, a few announcements, and finally, as the fire
died down to glowing embers, a story or two.
But Dale Tompkins had rarely been more perfectly
content.</p>

<p>Drawn together, perhaps, by the events of the
afternoon and by the interesting secret they held
in common, the members of Tent Three were
gathered in a group on one side of the circle.
Whether by accident or design, Dale sat close to
Ranny and a little behind him, where he could
watch the play of light and shadow on the leader&#8217;s
handsome face. Scarcely a word passed between
them, but Dale was conscious of something
in the other&#8217;s manner which made him wonder,
with a thrill, whether the hateful barrier that had
existed for so long between them wasn&#8217;t growing
a shade less formidable. Suppose some day it
should vanish altogether! Suppose the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
came when they could be real friends of the sort
he had always dreamed about! He told himself
that it was probably all imagination, but this did
not take away his pleasure in the picture. And
when Ranny, lazily shifting his lounging attitude,
leaned carelessly back against the knees of the boy
behind him, Dale thrilled to the touch almost as
much as he would have done had he not felt the
other to be quite unconscious of his presence.</p>

<p>The routine of the second morning in camp was
much the same as the first had been. But directly
after dinner the fellows piled into boats and rowed
out to where the <i>Aquita</i> was anchored. As many
as the power-boat would hold went aboard, leaving
the rest, with a large assortment of crab-nets,
hooks, lines, bait-boxes, and the like, in the trailers.
They made a hilarious bunch as they chugged upstream
past the straggling fishing-village, under
the bridge, and on between the low banks of sedge
and tough water-growth that lined the little river.
But the noise was as nothing compared with the
racket that began when they anchored and dispersed
for the afternoon sport.</p>

<p>Some took to the boats, others went ashore and
fished from the bank, while a few stayed on the
<i>Aquita</i>. The tide was out and it was an ideal
spot for crabbing. In fact, the creatures were so
plentiful that many of the boys abandoned the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
slower, more cautious method of luring them to
the surface with bait, and took to scooping them
off the bottom with nets, to the accompaniment
of excited shouts and yells and much splashing
of mud and water. They kept at it for about two
hours, and when the whistle summoned them back
to the motor-boat they brought along a catch big
enough to furnish several meals for the entire
camp.</p>

<p>The last boat to come in was rowed by Dale
Tompkins. Sanson and Bennie Rhead were with
him, besides one or two others; but the interest
and attention of those gathered on and about the
<i>Aquita</i> was swiftly centered on Harry Vedder,
perched precariously on the stern seat. His fat
legs were drawn up clumsily under him, his pudgy
hands tightly gripped the sides of the craft, while
his plump face was set in lines expressive of anything
but joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Puffy?&#8221; called Ranny
Phelps, as they approached. &#8220;You look like
Humpty Dumpty sitting on a wall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Vedder merely sniffed poutingly. The faces of
Tompkins and Sanson expanded in wide grins.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the crabs,&#8221; chuckled the latter. &#8220;They&#8217;re
so fond of him they won&#8217;t let him alone. You
see,&#8221; he added, his eyes dancing, &#8220;some of &#8217;em
happened to get out of the box, and the minute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
they saw Humpty they got terribly attached to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; snorted the plump youth indignantly&#8211;&#8220;to
one of my legs, the beastly things! Hurry
up, Dale, for goodness&#8217; sake; I&#8217;m all cramped
up!&#8221;</p>

<p>A snicker went up from the other boats. &#8220;You
ought to have spoken to &#8217;em sharply, Ved,&#8221;
grinned Ranny, &#8220;and discouraged such liberties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Court; &#8220;be firm with &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Vedder snorted again and, reaching for the rail
of the <i>Aquita</i>, climbed aboard with remarkable
agility. &#8220;Maybe you think that&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he
growled, taking possession of the most comfortable
seat in sight; &#8220;but I&#8217;d rather tackle a snake
any day than a boat-load of crabs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so taken up with his own affairs that
he quite missed the meaning glance that passed
between Court Parker and Bob Gibson as they
fastened their painter to the stern of the power-boat.
He thought nothing, either, of the fact that
they were first ashore, where, hastening to remove
from under one of the seats a medium-sized bait-box
covered with seaweed, they disappeared behind
the cook-shack.</p>

<p>But later on, an uncomfortable suspicion came
to him that there was something in the wind.
Approaching the cook-shack, where a crowd was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
occupied in breaking up shells and extracting
crab-meat for supper, he noticed Parker, Sanson,
and Tompkins giggling and whispering with
heads close together. As he came up they stopped
abruptly, but after supper he saw them again,
clustered in a group with Gibson and Bennie
Rhead, and caught a grinning glance from the
latter that deepened his suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;re up to some trick,&#8221; he said to
himself.</p>

<p>Uneasily, he kept a sharp lookout, determined
that they should not catch him napping. But
oddly enough, the joke, whatever it was, seemed
to subside, and for all his watchfulness Vedder
failed to detect any more suspicious confabs during
the evening.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he remained on guard, especially
after dark. He did not stray far from headquarters
without peering about for such pitfalls as
taut ropes, water-pails, and the like. At the council-fire
he selected his place with especial care,
and saw that no one approached from behind without
his knowing it. But the evening passed uneventfully,
and when he had reached the tent in
safety and was undressing by the light of the
single lantern, he decided he must have been
worrying to no purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I was wrong after all,&#8221; he thought,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
tying the pajama-strings about his ample waist.
&#8220;My, but bed&#8217;s going to feel good!&#8221;</p>

<p>If there was one thing Vedder took pains about,
it was in the arrangement of his blankets. To
avoid the unpleasant exposure of toes he had
worked out an elaborate system of folds and
safety-pins until the combination resembled a
sleeping-bag more than anything else. It was his
habit to attend to this immediately after supper
so that at bedtime there need be no shivery delay
in getting fixed for the night. This evening he
climbed ponderously to his perch, inwardly congratulating
himself on his forethought, for the
others, chattering busily on the day&#8217;s doings, were
only beginning to spread out their blankets.</p>

<p>&#8220;It pays to be systematic,&#8221; he thought complacently,
and thrust his legs between the warm
folds with a luxurious sigh of content.</p>

<p>An instant later a howl of terror resounded
through the camp, followed by a convulsive movement
of Vedder&#8217;s legs and body which disrupted
the neat arrangement in a flash. Dale Tompkins,
sitting on the edge of the lower bunk, had no time
even to roll aside before the fat boy, still gurgling
with fright, landed on him with a crash that shook
the tent.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MISSING SCOUT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What the mischief is the matter with you?&#8221;
demanded Tompkins, rubbing his head
where it had come into violent contact with the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A snake!&#8221; palpitated Vedder, from the entrance
of the tent, to which he had fled. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a snake in my bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy with the heat, Puffy!&#8221; exclaimed
Ranny Phelps, forcibly. &#8220;How could a
snake get into your bunk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s there, just the same,&#8221; panted Vedder, his
eyes bulging. &#8220;When I put my feet down they
hit against something cold and&#8211;and slimy that
squirmed about. Ugh! If I hadn&#8217;t got out so
quick, it would have bit me sure as anything. You
look and see, if you don&#8217;t believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the camp was astir. As Ranny
took the lantern and went over to Vedder&#8217;s bunk,
several boys from neighboring tents crowded in
to see what was up. When they learned the nature
of the rumpus they were vastly more excited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
than the other occupants of Tent Three, who
seemed strangely unaffected by the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hanged if there isn&#8217;t something here!&#8221; said
Ranny, in a puzzled tone, looking down on the
blankets. &#8220;Get a couple of sticks, fellows, and
some of you hold down the edges of the blankets
so it can&#8217;t get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Court Parker turned his back suddenly and
choked oddly; Tompkins&#8217;s face was flushed and
twitching. But the new-comers obeyed the order
with enthusiasm, and two of them, darting out,
returned in a few moments with a couple of crab-nets
and the heavy butt of a fishing-rod. Meanwhile,
Ranny and several others had drawn the
blankets taut across the bunk, revealing an irregular
bulge down near the foot that certainly moved
slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody hit together when I give the word,&#8221;
said Ranny. &#8220;One, two&#8211;three!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sticks descended with vigor, and there was
a violent wriggling and thrashing about beneath
the blankets. But the blows came thick and fast,
and in a moment or two all movement ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s dead, whatever it is,&#8221; said Ranny,
just as Mr. Reed and Mr. Curtis appeared behind
Vedder, still standing prudently in the background.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s open it up and have a look.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he turned down the blankets, the boys gripped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
their sticks tighter, ready for instant action in
case the reptile were not quite dead. But when
a final twitch exposed the cause of the commotion,
there was a moment&#8217;s silence, followed by a united
exclamation of surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s nothing but an eel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly a yell of laughter went up. Parker
and several other occupants of the tent rolled on
their bunks in paroxysms of delight. The two
scoutmasters, smiling broadly, slipped away.
Vedder, jaws agape, stared at Ranny as if unable
to believe his hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8211;eel?&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; grinned Ranny. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
the whole camp stirred up over a blooming eel instead
of a snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat boy&#8217;s teeth came together with a click,
and, with face flaming, he flounced over to his
bunk. &#8220;You fellows put it there!&#8221; he accused
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never!&#8221; chuckled Frank Sanson. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet it got fond of you, like the crabs, and climbed
up there to make friends. And now they&#8217;ve gone
and smashed the poor thing all up, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>A roar of laughter drowned his words, and
Vedder, grabbing up the eel, flung it square at his
tormentor. But Frank ducked, and the slimy missile
flew past his head to land with a thud on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
sand outside. A moment later the sound of taps
sent everybody scurrying for his bunk; but for
some time after lights were out subdued giggles
could be heard from all parts of the camp.</p>

<p>For at least an hour next morning Vedder was
very dignified and offish. But he was too easy-going
to maintain a grudge very long, and before
dinner he had become his comfortable, smiling self
again. It was noticed, however, that during the
remainder of his stay in camp he pointedly ignored
the entire race of snakes, eels, and kindred
reptiles.</p>

<p>The athletic meet was a great success. The
scouts were divided, according to weight, into
juniors and seniors, and there was keen competition
in the running, jumping, and swimming
events. But great as was the interest excited, it
seemed excelled the following afternoon when the
crowd set out to resume their hunt for the lost copper-mine.
This was both a competition and a
fascinating mystery, and a good many beside the
members of Tent Three had apparently fallen victims
to the spell.</p>

<p>When they reached the starting-point and separated,
Ranny and his bunch lost no time in heading
for the old foundation. A little digging
opened up what seemed to have been the main
entrance to the building, but, search as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
might, they failed to find anything that in the least
resembled a road or path or tramway leading to
the mine entrance. Evidently the means by
which ore was formerly brought to the smelter
had been obliterated by the passing years, and it
looked as if they would have to proceed from this
point more or less at random.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be so very far off,&#8221; said Ranny, as
they lined up before him. &#8220;We&#8217;d better take the
hillside first, and remember to look over every
foot of ground. The entrance may have been
covered by a fall of rock, so we can&#8217;t count on
finding it open. Keep about the same distance
apart as you were the other day, and whistle if
you strike anything promising.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set off promptly, Dale Tompkins as before
being about the middle of the line, with
Court Parker on his right. The thick undergrowth
and the rocks piled up in confusion made
progress necessarily slow and prevented him
from seeing very far in any direction. But every
now and then the rustling of bushes or the cracking
of dead twigs under foot on either side told
Dale that he was keeping on the right course.</p>

<p>For over an hour he searched systematically,
zigzagging back and forth along his beat and
examining the ground carefully. The slope grew
steeper, and at length he paused to wipe the perspiration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
from his forehead. The sound of foot-falls
on his right was plainly audible, and
through the undergrowth he glimpsed a khaki-clad
figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Court,&#8221; he called, raising his voice
slightly, &#8220;found anything yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not Court,&#8221; came back in Frank Sanson&#8217;s
familiar tones. &#8220;What the dickens are you doing
so far over, Tommy? Did you change places?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no!&#8221; Dale&#8217;s voice was puzzled; instinctively
he moved toward the other boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been keeping right along the way I started,&#8221; he
went on, as they came face to face. &#8220;Court was
on this side then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! He was on my left. I haven&#8217;t seen
him for half an hour or more, but I kept hearing
him every now and then. You don&#8217;t suppose he
could have strayed over behind you and to the
other side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how. I&#8217;d have heard him,
wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or so the two boys stood looking
at one another in a puzzled fashion. &#8220;It&#8217;s
funny,&#8221; Sanson said at length. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t
have gone back, either. If he found something,
he&#8217;d have whistled. Let&#8217;s call and see if he&#8217;s
over the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tompkins nodded, and together they walked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
briskly back a few steps. But it was Ranny
Phelps who answered their hail, and in a few
moments they saw him coming toward them
through the brush.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked quickly. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
found&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s Court,&#8221; interrupted Tompkins. &#8220;He
started out between Frank and me, but he must
have got mixed up somehow, for we can&#8217;t find
him. We thought he might be over your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him,&#8221; said Ranny, briefly. He
hesitated an instant and then, pursing up his lips,
whistled shrilly. &#8220;Best way&#8217;s to get them all
together and straighten things out,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;If he&#8217;s off his beat, the chances are that part of
the ground isn&#8217;t being looked over at all. This
way, fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob Gibson was the first to hurry up. Then
came Trexler, Bennie Rhead, and lastly Vedder,
panting with his haste. But Parker was not
among them, nor did Ranny&#8217;s repeated whistling
bring sight or sound of the missing boy. None
of the others had seen him since leaving the old
foundation, and as they stood there, puzzled and
a bit anxious, Tompkins suddenly remembered
that for some little time before the meeting with
Sanson he had failed to hear the rustlings on his
right that had kept him aware of Court&#8217;s presence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
At the time it had seemed unimportant, but
now he made haste to mention it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bennie, you chase back to the smelter and see
if he&#8217;s there by any chance,&#8221; ordered Ranny,
crisply, when Dale had finished. &#8220;The rest of
us get in a close line and beat back along Court&#8217;s
territory. I can&#8217;t imagine anything happening
to him that Tompkins or Sanson wouldn&#8217;t hear
or know about&#8211;unless, of course, it&#8217;s a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>His jaw squared in a way that boded ill for the
volatile Courtlandt if this should prove to be one
of his familiar escapades. But, somehow, Tompkins
did not believe that this could be the explanation.
Court had been too keenly enthusiastic
about the search to delay it by senseless
horse-play. Though he, no more than Ranny,
could think of any accident which would render
the boy unconscious without his making a sound
of any sort, Dale took his place in the line with
a feeling of distinct uneasiness.</p>

<p>So close together that they could almost touch
each other&#8217;s outstretched hands, the scouts
started down the slope. There was little conversation,
for by this time all were more or less
worried. Just where they expected to find the
missing boy would have been hard to tell, but a
rabbit could scarcely have escaped their close
scrutiny of bush and rock and thorny tangle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>It was fifteen minutes or so before they came
to a giant rock that thrust its lichened bulk up
from the forest mold. At least that was what it
seemed at first&#8211;a single, flat-topped mass of
stone, ten or twelve feet through and about as
high. But passing close to one side, Tompkins
and Sanson discovered that it was split in two
pieces, one of which had fallen away from the
other just enough to leave a jagged crack, not
more than three feet wide, between them. A
spreading mass of laurel screened the opening
from any but the closest inspection, and as
he pushed this to one side Dale gave a sudden
start and stared intently at the ground beneath
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that!&#8221; he exclaimed, turning to
Frank, who was close behind.</p>

<p>The latter pressed forward and glanced over
his shoulder. &#8220;What? Oh! You mean&#8211; Gee!
Didn&#8217;t you break it off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s heart was beating unevenly as he bent
to pick up the tiny broken twig. There were
three leaves on it, as fresh and green as those on
the parent bush; the broken end showed white
and living. He met Sanson&#8217;s glance and, dropping
the twig, stepped into the jagged crevice.
A moment later he gave a smothered cry. At his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
feet lay a scout hat of brown felt. A few inches
beyond yawned a black hole, the leaves and mold
and rotten branches about its edges scuffed and
torn and freshly broken.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>LOST MINE FOUND</span></h2>

<p>For a long moment the two boys stood motionless,
staring wide-eyed and dismayed at the
gaping hole before them. Then Dale came to himself
with a sudden stiffening of the muscles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Ranny!&#8221; he snapped over his shoulder.
And even as the words passed his lips he was
conscious of a thrill of thankfulness that the older
fellow was here to depend upon. A second later
he was stretched out on the ground, his head thrust
over the hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Court!&#8221; he called loudly. &#8220;Court&#8211;are you
down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant there was no sound. Then his
words beat back on him in a queer, sardonic kind
of echo that sent a shiver flickering down his spine.
He called again, but still there was no reply.
Staring down, he tried to penetrate the darkness,
but his straining sight could make out nothing but
black void. A vivid picture of the mine-shaft he
had once seen in Pennsylvania flashed into his
mind and turned him cold. Then a step sounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
behind him, and lifting his head, he looked into
Ranny&#8217;s set face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scrambling to his feet, Dale flattened out
against the rock and Ranny took his place. Two
or three times the latter shouted Parker&#8217;s name,
but only the echo answered. Then he stood up,
and, squeezing past Tompkins, pressed through
the crowd of boys gathered about the entrance
to the crevice. His face was a little pale, but his
jaw was square and he held a scout whistle in one
hand. A moment later three long shrill blasts resounded
through the woods.</p>

<p>It was the scout danger-signal&#8211;a call for help.
The boys stood motionless, listening intently for
an answer. Presently it came, two short blasts,
rather faint and far off, from over the top of the
hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mr. Reed, I guess,&#8221; said Ranny. &#8220;I
hope he&#8217;ll bring that coil of rope along. But of
course he will. He&#8217;s not the kind to forget
any&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The words died on his lips; his eyes widened in
startled surprise. The others, following the direction
of his bewildered gaze, gasped and stared.
Bennie Rhead, returned from a fruitless trip to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
old foundation, cried out sharply, an undercurrent
of fright in his voice.</p>

<p>Around the corner of the great rock Court
Parker had stepped quietly into view. He was
bareheaded and dirt-streaked, but his face nevertheless
wore a broad grin, and after the first shock
of surprise had passed, Bob Gibson started forward
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;By heck!&#8221; he exclaimed irately. &#8220;If you
think this sort of thing is funny, Court Parker,
it&#8217;s about time somebody taught you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Bob!&#8221; cut in Ranny, curtly. His
quick eye had taken in the streak of blood
on Parker&#8217;s cheek and noted a slight twitching
at the corners of the boy&#8217;s smiling mouth.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not hurt, are you, Court?&#8221; he added
quickly.</p>

<p>Parker shook his head. &#8220;Not to speak of.&#8221;
He drew a long breath. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve found the
mine,&#8221; he went on in a voice which failed to be
quite as matter of fact as he evidently tried to
make it.</p>

<p>In an instant he was surrounded by the excited
boys and fairly bombarded with questions: &#8220;Did
you fall down the hole?&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s it like down
there?&#8221; &#8220;How did you get out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Court laughed a little shakily and sat down suddenly
on a rock. &#8220;Give me a chance, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
he begged. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only got one tongue, even
though I can make that go pretty fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out and quit worrying him, fellows,&#8221;
ordered Ranny. &#8220;Take your time, Court, and
start at the beginning. How did you get down
the hole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cinchiest thing you know!&#8221; grinned Parker.
&#8220;I just stepped on the cover and went through.
You see, when I went into that crack the hole
didn&#8217;t show at all; there were a lot of branches
and stuff over it. One minute I was on solid
ground, and the next I was flying through space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; exclaimed Sanson. &#8220;How deep was
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seemed about a mile; but I guess it wasn&#8217;t
more than twenty feet. Luckily there was a lot
of leaves and stuff at the bottom, so I landed
pretty soft. But when I tried to climb back I
found it was too slippery. Then I lost my voice
yelling, but nobody came, so I started to look
around a bit. It&#8217;s just one long tunnel, running
both ways and braced up by rotten old timbers
and things. I had my flash-light in my pocket, so
I wasn&#8217;t afraid of being lost. I took the right-hand
turn and&#8211;I say, fellows, there&#8217;s a bear
down there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear?&#8221; chorused the astonished audience as
one boy.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/illus6.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
In an instant he was surrounded by excited boys
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;Well, it might be a wildcat or something like
that. I only saw its eyes, but I tell you they held
me up, all right. About three hundred feet from
where I fell in there was another kind of a shaft
thing, only not so big, sort of off to one side. It
wasn&#8217;t very deep, either, for when I looked down
I saw those two big yellow eyes that didn&#8217;t seem
more than eight or ten feet down. Gee whiz!
I was scared. I must have got turned around,
too; because, when I came to, I found I was legging
it away from the big hole instead of back
toward it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and drew a long breath; his fascinated
hearers sighed in sympathy. &#8220;Did you
go back then?&#8221; one of them asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking about it,&#8221; resumed Court,
&#8220;when my thumb slipped off the flash-key, and
ahead of me, not so very far away, was a little
spot of light&#8211;daylight, you know. You&#8217;d better
believe I hustled for it. The tunnel had been
going up hill quite some, and now it began to get
narrower and lower. Before very long I had
to get down and crawl, and then I found the light
was coming between two rocks through a crack
that didn&#8217;t look more than a foot or so wide.
The bottom was pounded down hard in a regular
path; I s&#8217;pose that was the way the bear got in
to its den. Anyhow, there was just room for me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
to squeeze out, and even then I cut my face and
tore these holes in my suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind of small, then, for a full-grown bear, I
should think,&#8221; commented Ranny.</p>

<p>Court looked a trifle foolish. &#8220;I never thought
of that,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;Still, I bet a wildcat
could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might&#8211;only I haven&#8217;t heard of any wild-cats
being around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with our taking a look?&#8221;
suggested Dale Tompkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going through the hole Court came out of?&#8221;
asked Ranny, glancing at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! We&#8217;ve got some flash-lights, and very
likely the beast is stuck down that shaft and can&#8217;t
get out. I vote we try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two or three fellows backed him up, but the
others showed no great enthusiasm in the venture.
They were quite willing, however, to go as
far as the outside of the hole, and started off
without delay, only to meet Mr. Reed with Mr.
Curtis and several scouts coming up at a brisk
trot.</p>

<p>When Court&#8217;s story had been told over again
the scoutmasters decided that the investigation
had better be made from the end that Court had
stumbled into. They had brought the rope with
them, and when one end of this was firmly fastened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
Mr. Reed slid down into the old mine.
He spent some time inspecting the ancient timbering,
but finally decided that it was safe
enough for those who wished to follow him. This
meant the entire assembled crowd, and when all
were gathered at the bottom, Court led the way.</p>

<p>The tunnel was fairly wide and over six feet
high. It sloped gently upward and was quite dry,
thus accounting for the preservation of the massive
oak beams that acted as supports. Here and
there along the sides were the marks of tools, but
scarcely a vestige of ore remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vein petered out, I suppose,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Curtis. &#8220;That&#8217;s why it was abandoned, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interest of the scouts, however, was less
on the mine than on Court&#8217;s &#8220;wildcat.&#8221; As they
approached the shaft some hurried forward
while others kept prudently in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there yet!&#8221; announced Parker, peering
over the edge. &#8220;See his eyes! I wonder if&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not finish. Mr. Reed flashed the light
from his battery into the hole, and Trexler,
close beside him, gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a coon!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was; an uncommonly large specimen,
to be sure, but still exceedingly harmless and inoffensive.
In fact, at the flashes of light and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
sight of so many faces peering down on it, the
frightened creature shrank close to the side of
the pit as if trying to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fallen down and can&#8217;t get out!&#8221; exclaimed
Trexler. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I go down and get it, Mr. Reed?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hole was barely four feet across and not
more than twice as deep&#8211;a trial shaft, Mr. Curtis
suggested, probably sunk in the search for another
vein. Receiving permission, Paul simply
hung by his hands and dropped, and the interested
spectators saw him lift up the coon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor thing&#8217;s half starved,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Let down a couple of coats, fellows, and pull him
up. He&#8217;ll make a dandy camp mascot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea was hailed with delight. There was
little trouble in hoisting the creature to the surface
and pulling Trexler after him. Then the entire
crowd turned back to the entrance shaft, their
interest diverted to this new pet.</p>

<p>Back on the surface the assembly whistle was
blown, and the two scoutmasters made themselves
comfortable while waiting the arrival of
the throng they knew would be eager to inspect
the mine. The members of Tent Three, however,
did not linger. Obtaining permission to return
at once to camp, they hustled off, carrying the
coon with them, and for the brief remainder of the
day they were exceedingly busy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>Pete, as the mascot was christened, had to be
fed and housed and cared for, and it took some
time to build a crate strong enough to keep him
from escaping. At first he threatened to be killed
by kindness, but finally Trexler was voted his special
guardian, and in a surprisingly short time the
animal became noticeably docile and friendly. He
had an inordinate curiosity and was as full of
mischief as any monkey. But though the cook
frowned on him, his popularity with the scouts
increased with every day.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WISH OF HIS HEART</span></h2>

<p>And how swiftly those remaining days passed
with their mingling of work and play!
There were more fishing excursions and athletic
meets. One afternoon was devoted to an exciting
treasure-hunt; another saw a sham battle in which
part of the boys in boats attacked one of the
islands defended by the remainder. At regular
intervals, too, Captain Chalmers gave scout examinations
in headquarters tent, and an encouraging
number of fellows increased their standing or obtained
merit badges.</p>

<p>Dale Tompkins thoroughly enjoyed each minute
of his stay. He entered with keen zest into every
game and competition, and took his share of the
various chores&#8211;even the hated dish-washing&#8211;without
a grumble. It was all so fresh and wonderful
that the simplicity and freedom of the
life, with the nightly council-fire under the stars
and the intimate companionship with so many
&#8220;dandy&#8221; fellows, appealed to him intensely even
without considering the added interest of each
day&#8217;s activities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>Best of all, perhaps, was his feeling of growing
comfort in the attitude of Ranny Phelps. There
had been nothing in the nature of a formal reconciliation.
On the contrary, the blond lad&#8217;s manner
toward Tompkins still showed traces of embarrassment.
But one does not always need the
spoken word to realize the truth, and deep down
in his heart Dale knew that, though they might
not yet be close friends, at least no shadow of coldness
or enmity remained between them.</p>

<p>When the last day came, as last days have an
unpleasant way of doing, Dale tried to think of
the wonderful time he had had instead of regretting
that it was almost over. More than once,
too, his mind dwelt with gratitude on the unknown
customer whose need for bird-houses had made it
all possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe some day I&#8217;ll find out who it was and
be able to thank him,&#8221; he said to himself during
the course of the morning.</p>

<p>A final trip in the motor-boat had been planned
for the afternoon, but after dinner Captain Chalmers
announced that Mr. Thornton would inspect
the camp at about five o&#8217;clock, and stay for supper
and the council-fire afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I think we&#8217;d better put in a few hours
making things spick and span and working up a
specially good program for to-night,&#8221; he concluded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
&#8220;You fellows all know how keen I am to
give him an extra good impression of scouting,
and you&#8217;ve kept things in corking good shape
these two weeks. But let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t give
him a regular knock-out blow when he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>One and all the scouts took up the idea enthusiastically
and worked to such purpose that when
the banker appeared he found a camp which
would have done credit to the West Point cadets.
He was a little stiff at first, but during supper in
the big tent he thawed considerably, and later, at
the council-fire, he applauded the various stunts
with the enjoyment and simple abandon, almost,
of a boy. When these were over he rose to his
feet, and the firelight gleaming on his face showed
it softened into lines of genial good-fellowship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a mighty good time to-night, boys,&#8221;
he said, glancing around the circle of eager, young
faces. &#8220;I just want to thank you for it and tell
you frankly that what I&#8217;ve seen of Hillsgrove Boy
Scouts has changed my mind completely about the
whole proposition. If you fellows are a fair sample
of scouting generally,&#8211;as I begin to suspect
you are,&#8211;I see no reason why you should not consider
this camp a permanent thing, to come back
to every year and be responsible for and do with
as you like. I should very much&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The wild yell of delight which went up drowned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
the remainder of his remarks. Leaping to his
feet, MacIlvaine called for a cheer, and the three
times three, with a tiger at the end, was given with
a vigor that left no doubt of the boys&#8217; feelings.
When comparative quiet was restored Mr. Thornton
thanked them briefly and said he would like to
shake hands with every one of the scouts present.</p>

<p>Laughing and jostling, the boys formed in line,
and as each paused before the banker, Captain
Chalmers introduced him. Tompkins was just behind
Ranny, and he could not fail to notice the extra
vigor Mr. Thornton put into his handshake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad to meet you, Phelps,&#8221; he said
genially. &#8220;Your father and I are old friends.
In fact, I dined with him at Hillsgrove only a few
days ago. And by the way, I was immensely taken
with those bird-houses on the place and want some
like them for my own. He told me you had put
them around just before you came down here.
Did you make them yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>The usually self-contained Ranleigh turned
crimson and dropped his eyes. &#8220;N-no, sir,&#8221; he
stammered. &#8220;They were made by&#8211;by&#8211;another&#8211;I&#8217;ll
write the address down, and&#8211;and
give it to you afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed on, and the boy behind him took his
place. In a daze Dale felt his hand shaken and
heard the sound of Mr. Thornton&#8217;s pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
voice, but the words were as meaningless as if
they had been spoken in another tongue. Muttering
some vague reply, he dropped the other&#8217;s
hand and was swept on by the crowd behind.</p>

<p>Out of the whirling turmoil of his mind one
thing alone stood forth sharply. Those were <i>his</i>
bird-houses; they could not possibly be any other.
It was Ranny who had given him these wonderful
two weeks&#8211;Ranny, whom he thought&#8211;</p>

<p>His head went up suddenly and, glancing
around, he caught sight of the blond chap disappearing
toward the beach. In a few moments he
was at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ranny!&#8221; he exclaimed impulsively. &#8220;You&#8211;you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Something gripped his throat, making further
speech impossible. Phelps stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said with a touch of defiance, &#8220;I
wanted them, and&#8211;and I couldn&#8217;t make them myself.
I&#8211;I&#8217;m a perfect dub with tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you did it to&#8211;give me a chance at
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s voice was strained and uneven. His
hand still rested on the other&#8217;s arm, and in the
brief silence that followed he felt Ranny stiffen
a little.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/illus7.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Ranny!&#8221; he exclaimed impulsively. &#8220;You&#8211;you&#8211;&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8220;If I did, it was only fair,&#8221; the older chap said
suddenly, in low, abrupt tones. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;ve been a
beastly cad, Dale. I&#8217;ve worked against you every
way I could.&#8221; His voice grew sharp and self-reproachful.
&#8220;I kept it up like a stubborn mule
even when I began to see&#8211; Why, look at the rotten,
conceited way I kept you out of baseball.
After that it was only&#8211;decent to do what I could
to&#8211;make up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood in the moonlight, the water at their
feet, while back among the trees the fire blazed
up, sending a shower of sparks drifting across the
spangled heavens. The talk and laughter of the
crowd gathered there seemed to come from very
far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did it to&#8211;to square up, then?&#8221; Dale asked
presently in a low tone.</p>

<p>There was another pause. Suddenly an arm
slid about his shoulders, and for the first time
Ranny turned and looked him squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered quietly. &#8220;It was because I
wanted us to be in camp&#8211;together.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>The last barrier of reserve between the two
had fallen. From that moment they were
friends of the sort Dale had sometimes dreamed
of, but only lately dared to hope for. And as the
weeks lengthened into months, as summer sped
along to fall, the bond grew closer, until they became
well-nigh inseparable. In school and out, on
the football field, at scout meetings, on hikes, they
were always together, until at last those early days
of clash and bitterness seemed as unreal as the figments
of a dream.</p>

<p>Troop Five held well together during the following
winter. Inevitably, two or three boys
dropped out and new ones took their places. But
the majority stayed on and had better times than
ever on the lake and in their cabin. After Christmas
they began work in earnest on their share of
the big scout rally, which was to be given in the
spring to illustrate for the towns-people the aims
and purposes of scouting, and also as a means of
gaining new recruits. Every troop was to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
part, and not a little good-natured rivalry developed
between them.</p>

<p>Troop Five was to illustrate the various uses of
the scout staff in a number of drills and formations,
the most effective and also the most difficult
of which was one that Mr. Curtis called the riot
wedge. Though necessitating a good deal of hard
work, most of the boys were keen about it, for they
were determined to excel the work of the other
troops. Perhaps the only fellow who complained
was only Bob Gibson, and he wouldn&#8217;t have
seemed himself at all without finding something
to grumble about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! but I&#8217;m sick of this silly drill!&#8221; he
growled under his breath one night when they
had been practising steadily for an hour. He
slumped his shoulders a bit and his staff tilted to
a slovenly angle. &#8220;What&#8217;s the sense of it, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tention!&#8221; rang out the quick, decisive voice
of Scoutmaster Curtis, standing slim and erect
before the line of scouts. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try that once
more, fellows, and get a little snap into it this
time. Bob, if you could manage to support your
staff in an upright position, it would improve the
looks of the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no sting in his tone, and Bob, grinning
sheepishly, straightened his shoulders and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
brought his staff to the same angle as the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prepare to form riot wedge!&#8221; ordered the
scoutmaster, crisply. &#8220;One!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a rapid thud of feet and a swift,
scurrying movement which might have seemed
to the uninitiated meaningless and without purpose.
But when the stir had ceased and silence
fell, each of the three patrols had formed itself
into a regular wedge with one of the largest,
strongest boys at the apex and the patrol-leader
standing in the middle of the base. Their staves
were upright, but at the sharp command of
&#8220;Two!&#8221; these swung into a horizontal position,
the ends crossing and the whole becoming a continuous
barrier with the boys behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy!&#8221; approved Mr. Curtis.
&#8220;That&#8217;s more the way it ought to go. Now,
let&#8217;s try the double wedge I showed you last
week. Eagle patrol, dress a little to the left;
Beavers to the right. Ready? One!&#8221;</p>

<p>This time there was a little more confusion, for
the movement was newer and more complicated
than the other. Raven patrol took position as before,
though spreading out a bit and gathering in
a boy from each of the other patrols to form the
ends of the larger wedge. The Eagle and Beaver
patrols then swung around against either side of
the wedge, each boy covering the space between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
the two lads behind him. The final man&oelig;uver thus
presented a double row of scouts linked together
by their lowered staves into a formation that
would be equally effective in pushing through a
dense crowd or withstanding the pressure of their
assaults.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; smiled Mr. Curtis. &#8220;A bit slow, of
course, but we&#8217;ll get it all right. Now, fellows,
I&#8217;d like to have a full attendance next week.
Captain Chalmers will address the troop on a special
matter, and I think by that time I&#8217;ll have a
rather pleasant surprise for you. Has any one
any questions to ask before we break up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Court Parker saluted, his face serious save for
an irrepressible twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
you&#8211;er&#8211;tell us about the surprise to-night, sir?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Next week&#8217;s an awful long time off,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scoutmaster smiled. &#8220;You&#8217;ll enjoy it all
the more when it comes,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Besides,
it isn&#8217;t quite ready to be told yet. I think that&#8217;s
all to-night, fellows. Patrol-leaders dismiss their
patrols.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the crowd poured out of the building a chorus
of eager speculation arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder if it&#8217;s anything to do with camp,&#8221;
suggested Frank Sanson.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could it be?&#8221; objected Dale Tompkins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
his arm across Ranny Phelps&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Camp
couldn&#8217;t be much better than it was last summer;
and if he&#8217;s had word we can&#8217;t use the place&#8211;well,
that wouldn&#8217;t be exactly pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, old scout!&#8221; approved Ranny. Then his
face grew suddenly serious. &#8220;Do you suppose it
could be about&#8211;the war?&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence. In Hillsgrove,
as in most other parts of the country, war
and rumors of war had been plentiful of late.
The ruthless German submarine campaign had
been on for weeks. Only a few days before, the
severing of diplomatic relations with that government
had made a great stir. Everywhere people
were wondering what would be the next step, and,
according to temperament or conviction, were complaining
of governmental sloth or praising the
President&#8217;s diplomacy. In all of this the boys had
naturally taken more or less part, wondering,
speculating, planning&#8211;a little spectacularly, perhaps&#8211;what
they would do if war actually came.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob Gibson sniffed. &#8220;Shucks!&#8221; he
commented dogmatically. &#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t.
I don&#8217;t believe in this war business. I&#8217;ll bet that
old surprise is some silly thing not worth mentioning.
I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s as foolish as the riot wedge.
If anybody can tell me what good that is or ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
would be, I&#8217;ll give him an ice-cream soda. When
would there ever be a riot in this one-horse burg?
I&#8217;d like to know. And if there was one, what
would a bunch of fellows like us be able to do
against&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, cut it out!&#8221; begged Ranny Phelps. &#8220;You
know you&#8217;re just talking to hear the sound of
your own voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am not!&#8221; growled Gibson, stubbornly. &#8220;Here
we&#8217;ve wasted over an hour on the blooming thing,
and it&#8217;s not the first time, either, he&#8217;s kept us
late. It&#8217;s getting to be nothing but drill, drill,
drill, and it makes me sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an idiot just because you happen to
know how,&#8221; urged Ranny, a touch of earnestness
beneath his banter. &#8220;You know perfectly well it
isn&#8217;t all drill, or anything like it. Maybe there&#8217;s
been more of it just lately, but I don&#8217;t see any
sense in taking up a thing unless you do it right.
Trouble with you, Bob, you&#8217;re so set and stubborn
that you&#8217;ve got to find something to kick
about or argue against or you wouldn&#8217;t be happy.
I&#8217;ll bet if Dan Beard himself came out for a talk,
you&#8217;d want to give him points on camping, or
forestry, or something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter from the others
that brought a touch of color to Gibson&#8217;s cheeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
He growled out an emphatic denial, but Ranny
had hit the mark so accurately that Bob dropped
the subject for the time.</p>

<p>There was not a vacant place in the line the
next Monday, and when the scout commissioner
stepped forward to speak he was greeted with
flattering attention. Some of this was due to his
position in the movement; but a great deal more,
it must be confessed arose from the fact that he
was an exceedingly active and competent officer
in the national guard, and as such was regarded
by the boys as a rather superior being.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only a few words to say, fellows,&#8221; Captain
Chalmers began. &#8220;From now on I want you
all to work extra hard on your signaling and first
aid. These are the two features of scouting
which, in the near future, may be particularly
valuable. Keep up your practice for the rally,
but give all the rest of your spare time to these
two things. There&#8217;s one more point. How many
of you would like to learn something of the regular
military drill? Those interested, step forward
one pace.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a swift movement the whole line swayed
forward. Captain Chalmers nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to make this another
feature of the rally. With your permission, Mr.
Curtis, I&#8217;ll start them in on the rudiments to-night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
The staves, of course, will take the place
of arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hour which followed seemed one of the
briefest the boys had ever known. The captain
was no easy taskmaster, but not even Bob Gibson
grumbled. There was something inspiring in
those snappy, authoritative orders, in the rhythmic
tramp of marching feet, in the growing sense
of efficiency and pride with each movement understood
and properly executed. Every one of the
twenty-four scouts put his whole being into the
work, and in the end they were rewarded by Captain
Chalmers&#8217;s pleased approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; he said when at length they
stood at ease. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d do so well.
Keep it up in that spirit, and we&#8217;ll all be proud
of you. After this, Mr. Curtis will do the drilling.
Besides practising what you&#8217;ve already
learned, one new evolution thoroughly mastered
at each meeting will be about all you ought to
undertake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped back, and Mr. Curtis took his place.
At the sight of the folded paper in his hand a
sudden ripple of interest ran down the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; muttered Frank Sanson. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten
all about the surprise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter here from Mr. Thornton, fellows,&#8221;
said the scoutmaster, unfolding the paper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
Smiling a little, his glance ranged over the long
line of eager, inquiring faces; then it dropped to
the sheet before him, and he read aloud slowly:</p>

<div class='blockq'>
<p>&#8220;My dear Curtis:</p>

<p>&#8220;As you know from my note of ten days or more ago, I
have amused myself during the past few months by having
a permanent mess-shack and recreation-room built on the site
of the big dining-tent. The finishing touches will be put to
this within a few days, and I think something in the nature
of a housewarming is in order. It will give me great pleasure
if your troop can be my guests down at the camp during
their Easter vacation, which begins, I understand, toward the
last of the month. By that time the weather ought to be
mild enough for a week of tent life&#8211;at least for Boy Scouts;
and there will always be the new building to fall back on. I
will see to the transportation back and forth, and I hope
every one of your boys will be able to come.</p>

<p class='tar mr40'>&#8220;Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class='sc tar'>&#8220;John Thornton.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>For an instant there was a dazed silence
throughout the room. Then a yell broke forth
which could have been heard&#8211;and was&#8211;as far
as the green. Breaking ranks, boys clutched one
another in exuberant embraces and pranced
madly about the hall. Then there was more
shouting, and throwing-up of hats, and general
disorder, which Mr. Curtis made no attempt to
check. When failing breath brought comparative
quiet, he raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gather that the invitation meets with your
approval,&#8221; he remarked with a smile. &#8220;Shall I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
send Mr. Thornton the grateful acceptance of the
whole troop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; came back promptly and emphatically
from a dozen voices. &#8220;Wough! He&#8217;s
<i>some</i> good sport!&#8221; &#8220;Think of it, fellows! A
new mess-shack! A whole week in camp in
April!&#8221; &#8220;Pinch me, somebody; I don&#8217;t believe
I&#8217;m awake at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last speaker was promptly accommodated,
and after a little additional skylarking, things
quieted down. Before the meeting broke up, Mr.
Curtis wrote a letter of sincere thanks and acceptance
to John Thornton, which each one of the
scouts signed with a flourish. After that, with
youthful inconsequence, they hustled home to obtain
parental sanction.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WAR!</span></h2>

<p>In some miraculous fashion the necessary permission
was obtained by each and every one of
the boys of Troop Five, and bright and early on
the morning after school closed the whole crowd
was packed into the motor-truck, jouncing southward
over roads very much the worse for spring
thaws. It was, in fact, a vastly more uncomfortable
trip than the one last summer. But overhead
the skies were cloudless; warm breezes,
faintly odorous of spring and growing things,
caressed their cheeks, and youth was in their
hearts. What cared they for hard seats, for
jolts and jounces, for mud-holes, delays, and the
growing certainty of a late arrival? A thrilling
week, golden with possibilities, lay before them,
and nothing else mattered. They chattered and
sang and ate, and stopped by wayside springs, and
ate again. The sun was setting when they lumbered
into Clam Cove and tumbled out of the
truck to find the old <i>Aquita</i> waiting at the landing.
Then came the chugging passage of the bay,
and the landing at the new dock they had not even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
heard of, but where they did not pause long, so
eager were they all to inspect the mess-shack, bulking
large and unfamiliar through the gathering
dusk.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t really a shack at all, but a commodious
log structure some forty feet by twenty&#8211;big,
airy, and spacious. There were benches and
tables of rough yet solid construction, bracket-lamps,
many windows, and a cavernous stone fireplace
in which a roaring blaze of logs leaped and
crackled. The size and scale of it all fairly awed
the boys, and they stared eagerly around for Mr.
Thornton. To their disappointment the banker
was not to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had to go to Washington unexpected,&#8221; explained
the man in charge to Mr. Curtis. &#8220;But
he sent word you was to make yourselves at
home, and he&#8217;d be back just as soon as he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>This put a momentary damper on the affair,
but it was not of long duration. There was too
much to see and do in the short time at their disposal
for regrets of any sort. There was little
accomplished that night, however. After a hearty
supper, beds were made up on the floor and every
one was glad to turn in early.</p>

<p>They were up with the sun, and then began a
strenuous period of mingled work and play which
filled to overflowing each waking hour of the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
days that followed. They got out the tents and
erected them in the old places. They took hikes
and motor-boat trips; they fished and explored,
talked to each other with signal-flags, and put in
a commendable amount of time on their drill.
They were so constantly employed extracting the
last atom of enjoyment from the brief vacation
that they quite failed to notice the slight abstraction
of their scoutmaster, or the manner in which
he watched the mails and fairly devoured the daily
paper. Not one of them found time even to
glance at that paper himself, much less think of, or
discuss the affairs of the nation and the world.
Then, suddenly, came the awakening.</p>

<p>It was toward noon on the fourth day of their
stay&#8211;a Tuesday; they remembered that afterward.
The crowd had been for a hike to Lost
Mine, and, returning, had dawdled lazily, for the
air was almost oppressively balmy. Dale, Ranny,
and Court Parker were considerably ahead of the
others, and as they reached the parade-ground
they came suddenly upon Harry Vedder, whose
turn it had been to fetch the mail and paper. The
plump boy&#8217;s face was flushed and moist; his expression
fairly exuded importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he stated, without waiting for them
to speak. &#8220;It&#8217;s come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ranny stared. &#8220;Come?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
are you talking about, Dumpling? What&#8217;s
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vedder puffed out his fat cheeks. &#8220;War!&#8221; he
said solemnly.</p>

<p>For an instant no one spoke. Dale felt a queer,
tingling thrill go through him. The thing
seemed unreal, impossible. Somehow these past
few weeks of delay and hesitation had thrust the
idea farther and farther into the background of
his mind. He caught a glimpse of Parker&#8217;s face,
dazed and incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; gasped Ranny. &#8220;You mean with&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; nodded Vedder. &#8220;The President made
a fine speech last night to Congress, or something.
I heard &#8217;em talking about it at the post-office.
Everybody&#8217;s as excited as the dickens. I guess
it&#8217;s in all the papers, too, only Mr. Curtis&#8217;s
wasn&#8217;t open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s eyes sought headquarters tent. Under
the rolled-up flap he could see the scoutmaster
sitting on his cot, his head bent intently over an
outspread paper. Again that curious tingling
went through the boy. Behind him the shouts
and laughter of the approaching crowd seemed
suddenly incongruous and out of place. He
glanced again at Vedder, whose round face still
radiated self-importance, and wondered how the
boy could look so smug and complacent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>&#8220;Did Congress declare war?&#8221; asked Ranny,
abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno; I guess so. They&#8217;re going to raise
a whopping army. I heard one man say everybody
from nineteen to twenty-five would have to
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Have</i> to go!&#8221; shrilled Court Parker. &#8220;Why,
they&#8217;ll <i>want</i> to go, won&#8217;t they? I wish I was
more than sixteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unconsciously the four were moving toward
the scoutmaster&#8217;s tent. Others, hearing a word
or two, caught up with them, and the news was
passed quickly along. The throng paused at the
tent entrance. Dale caught a glimpse of the
newspaper across the top of which flared in black
capitals:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR WAR
DECLARATION</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, then, Mr. Curtis!&#8221; Ranny Phelps
exclaimed. &#8220;I thought it was coming. When
are they going to&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your horses, Ranny,&#8221; interrupted the
scoutmaster. He stood up and came toward
them, his face curiously elated. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
time to answer a lot of questions now. Mess-call
will sound any time. Hustle and wash up, fellows,
and after dinner we&#8217;ll talk this over.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>Curious and excited as they were, no one protested.
They scattered to their tents, chattering
volubly, and the mess-call found them still speculating
and asking questions of one another. During
the meal the discussion continued but in a
slightly more subdued key. A state of things
which at first had seemed merely exciting and
soul-stirring was coming home more keenly.
They were beginning to make individual applications.
Captain Chalmers would be called out, of
course. Though over thirty, Mr. Curtis himself
might enlist. Then some one thought suddenly
of Wesley Becker, who was just nineteen. That
seemed the strangest thing of all, for Wes, despite
his semi-leadership, was merely one of themselves.
But of course it was all the merest speculation;
they didn&#8217;t really know anything yet. So when
the meal was over and Mr. Curtis rose slowly in
his place, there was a long, concerted sigh of relaxing
tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; began the scoutmaster, quietly, &#8220;I
want to read you the President&#8217;s message delivered
to Congress last night. You won&#8217;t find it
dull. On the contrary it&#8217;s about the most vivid,
vital piece of writing I have ever read. It puts
clearly before us the situation we are facing. It
will make you prouder than ever of your country
and its head.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>And without further preamble he began to read
that wonderful document which has stirred the
world and has taken its place among the immortal
utterances of men. And as he read, eyes
brightened, boyish faces flushed, brown hands
gripped the rough edges of bench or table, or
strained tightly over clasped knees. He finished,
and there came a brief, eloquent moment of utter
silence, followed by a swift outburst of wild applause.</p>

<p>The scoutmaster&#8217;s face lit up with a smile.
&#8220;It&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Makes you feel
mighty proud to have a man like that at the
helm.&#8221; He folded the paper and laid it on the
table before him. &#8220;And now,&#8221; he went on, his
shoulders squaring a bit, &#8220;I want to say a few
words myself. A state of war exists, for Congress
cannot help but back up the man who wrote
that message. It&#8217;s been coming for a long time.
Many of us have felt it and tried to plan a little
in advance. Your signaling and first aid and
drilling have all been with that idea in view.
What I want now is that you shall give more time
than ever to those things&#8211;practically all the rest
of your time in camp here. Remember George
Lancaster, that English chap who was in Troop
One several years ago. To-day he&#8217;s one of the
best signalers in the British army. It will mean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
hard work, but, unless I&#8217;m far wrong, work will
swiftly come to be the great slogan throughout
the country. Will you do this, fellows? Stand
up, every one who&#8217;s willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a rush, a clatter&#8211;a bench was
overturned&#8211;in ten seconds not a boy remained
seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; smiled Mr. Curtis. &#8220;I thought I could
count on you. When Mr. Thornton comes on
Friday we&#8217;ll show him something that will surprise
him. And we&#8217;ll give those folks at the
rally something to think about, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are we still going to have the rally, sir?&#8221;
asked Bob Gibson.</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis laughed. &#8220;Of course we are,&#8221; he
said emphatically. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think, Bob,
that a state of war is going to disrupt the entire
country. That would be hysterical. There&#8217;ll be
unusual doings, of course. Things will be a bit
different in many ways. But school and chores
and all the ordinary routine of your daily lives
must go on as they always have. Suppose we get
out now and work up a little program for Mr.
Thornton&#8217;s benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The days that followed, so radically different
from anything the boys had planned, showed up
their spirit admirably. Of course there were
grumblers; those develop in any situation where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
discipline is involved. There were many moments
of weariness and discouragement, too,
when it seemed as if proficiency could never be
attained. But underneath it all, stirring, invigorating,
that wonderful sense of service&#8211;service to
another, service to their country, perhaps, upheld
and strengthened them. What they were doing
was not merely play. Some day or other, far
away or near, it would be of value; and the measure
of that value no man could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton was due to reach camp Friday
afternoon. The <i>Aquita</i>, in charge of Wesley
Becker and another scout, went over to meet him,
and as soon as the motor-boat was seen returning,
a bugle blast summoned the others hastily
from their tents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall in!&#8221; ordered Mr. Curtis, crisply.
&#8220;Phelps will take charge while I go down to the
dock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only their eyes moved, but these followed him
to the landing and they saw Mr. Thornton step
ashore and pause for a moment or two of conversation
before heading for the parade-ground.
The banker&#8217;s face looked tired and his shoulders
drooped a little. But as he caught sight of the
scouts drawn up in a straight, soldierly line behind
the colors his head went up and his eyes
brightened with surprise and interest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tention, troop!&#8221; called Mr, Curtis, sharply.
&#8220;Right dress!&#8211;Front!&#8211;Present arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;arms&#8221; were, of course, their staves, but
the man&oelig;uver was executed with a snap and precision
which many a company of militia might
have envied. Then came the command, &#8220;Count
off!&#8221; followed by, &#8220;Fours left&#8211;march!&#8221; and
the squad swung smartly down the parade-ground.</p>

<p>In the half-hour of man&oelig;uvering which followed&#8211;and
this included some fairly difficult formations
for new recruits&#8211;every boy gave the best
that was in him. And when it was all over, the
expression on Mr. Thornton&#8217;s face was quite reward
enough. At the command, &#8220;Fall out!&#8221; they
surged around him, shaking him by the hand,
thanking him exuberantly, and all trying at once
to tell him how much more wonderful everything
was than they had expected.</p>

<p>The council-fire that night was built out on the
point instead of in the great stone fireplace. Because
of Mr. Thornton&#8217;s presence, a special program
had been arranged. There were scout
games and stunts in abundance, songs galore, and
a number of other features which had proved effective
last summer. But it wasn&#8217;t quite all
gaiety and careless amusement. Mingling with
the joking and laughter and occasional bit of skylarking
was a touch of sober seriousness. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
their last night in camp together. Moreover,
from that momentous Tuesday things had never
been really quite the same. Their daily drills and
practice were rousing in them a sense of responsibility.
They knew that all over the country
preparations for war were being pushed energetically.
There had been time also, to hear
from home&#8211;of how this brother talked of enlisting
in the marines, or that cousin, a member of
Captain Chalmers&#8217;s own regiment, who had been
ordered to hold himself in readiness to join the
colors. And so at the end, standing shoulder to
shoulder around the blaze, their young voices ringing
out in the stirring strains of &#8220;America,&#8221; more
than one throat tightened, and there were few
who did not feel a tingling thrill beyond the thrill
those verses usually evoked.</p>

<p>There came a pause. Then slowly John Thornton
rose and stood for a moment facing them in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank you, boys,&#8221; he said at length,
in tones which emotion had rendered brusk and
almost harsh. &#8220;It&#8211;it has been a privilege and
more than pleasure to see your surprising work
this afternoon and to be with you in this way to-night.
I am proud of you&#8211;prouder than you can
ever know. I can say nothing more than this,&#8221;
and his voice rang out suddenly with a note that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
stirred them inexplicably: &#8220;If only the youth of
our country will measure up to your standards in
the crisis that is before us, we need fear nothing
for the future.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;EVERY SCOUT TO FEED A SOLDIER&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>The returning scouts found Hillsgrove buzzing
with preparation. In fact, so changed
was the atmosphere of the town that it was hard
to believe they had been away for little more than
a week. Several of the young men had already
enlisted in army or navy. The post-office, courthouse,
and many of the stores displayed inspiring
posters urging others to do the same. A home
guard was being organized for the purpose of
dealing effectually with any sort of disturbance
from resident foreigners, while a number of men,
both young and middle-aged, talked of forming
a regular military troop to be drilled twice weekly
on the green by army officers or men who had
been at Plattsburg.</p>

<p>It was all stirring and inspiring, and there is
no telling to what extent the members of Troop
Five might have become involved had not Mr.
Curtis given them a serious talk at the first meeting
after their return from camp. Captain Chalmers
had departed with his regiment to take up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
guard duty along the line in one of the important
railroads of the State, leaving Mr. Curtis in
general charge of the scout situation at Hillsgrove;
so that this talk was later repeated in substance
at meetings of the other troops.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re all very keen to get into things
and do your bit,&#8221; he said, when the boys gathered
around him in the parish-house. &#8220;The only
question, of course, is how you can be most useful
without frittering away your time. I&#8217;ve
taken the matter up with headquarters, and talked
it over with the mayor and several other men,
and have come to this conclusion: first of all,
we&#8217;ll go ahead with our preparations for the
rally, but instead of having it a free exhibition,
as we planned, we&#8217;ll charge admission and turn
over the proceeds to the Red Cross. Next, I&#8217;m
going to organize a signaling corps and a first-aid
division formed of the real experts in each
troop. There may be no immediate use for either
of these, but you&#8217;ll be ready when the time comes.
Then there is the detail of helping to keep public
order, in which the Boy Scouts have always been
especially useful. There is no telling when or
where you may be called upon, but your training
and discipline helps you to quick thinking and
action.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused an instant, and then his voice took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
on a deeper, more earnest note. &#8220;But more important
than anything else just now is the need
for each one of you to do everything in his power
to help conserve and increase the food supply.
All over the world this supply is low. The whole
of Europe looks to us for a goodly proportion of
its daily bread, and we&#8217;ve got to meet that expectation.
We&#8217;ve got to make this a year of
bumper crops, even at a time when labor will
naturally be scarcer than ever. And to help out
in this crisis the men at the head of the Boy
Scout movement have adopted a motto&#8211;a slogan&#8211;which
should be first and foremost in every
scout&#8217;s mind until the war is over. &#8216;Every Scout
to Feed a Soldier!&#8217; Isn&#8217;t that fine? A scout with
a hoe may equal a man with a gun. The President
himself has stated more than once that a
man may serve his country as effectually in the
corn-field as at the front. And how much more
is this the duty of a boy whose age makes it impossible
for him to reach the firing-line. I&#8217;ve
known you fellows too long and too intimately to
have any doubts as to your responses to this appeal.
Those of you who have home gardens that
will take all your time must look after them, releasing,
if possible, some man for other work.
The others, I hope, will volunteer their services to
any one needing them, and I expect very soon to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
have an organized clearing-house for farmers in
the neighborhood needing help and boys willing
to furnish it. I may say that any one going into
this will be allowed to absent himself from the
afternoon school session and all day on Wednesdays.
Later, the schools may be closed entirely
for workers. Now, I know this doesn&#8217;t sound
nearly so stirring and patriotic as joining a military
company and drilling and all that; but this
isn&#8217;t a moment in which to pick and choose. The
duty of each one of us is to give himself where he
is most needed. And, believe me, fellows, by helping
to plant and harvest you will be performing
the highest sort of service to your country and
humanity. I want you to think this over to-night,
and from to-morrow on I&#8217;ll be ready to take the
names of volunteers.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rather silent crowd that filed out of
the meeting-room a little later. To the great majority
Mr. Curtis&#8217;s proposition certainly didn&#8217;t
sound in the least interesting or alluring. On
the contrary it had a decidedly depressing effect,
and several openly declared that they&#8217;d be
hanged if they&#8217;d spend the entire summer in that
kind of drudgery. But second thought, aided,
perhaps, by a little solid advice at home, wrought
a change. The next afternoon the fellows held a
private meeting of their own at which the few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
persistent objectors were crushed by bodily force,
when necessary, and which ended in the whole
troop volunteering as a body.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t at all an easy thing for some of them
to do. In boys like Ranny Phelps, who loathed
&#8220;grubbing with a hoe&#8221; and had never had the
slightest experience in farming, it was something
almost akin to heroism. But not one of them
shirked or backed down. Within a week they
were all placed, and, from that time on, blistered
hands, weary backs, and aching muscles were the
order of the day. As Ranny once expressed it,&#8211;airily,
but with an underlying touch of seriousness,&#8211;the
only bright spots in the week were
Sunday, when they could sleep late, and the two
afternoons they were let off at four o&#8217;clock to
practise for the rally.</p>

<p>They made the most of those brief hours. In
good weather the drill took place in a pasture belonging
to old Mr. Grimstone, after which they
enjoyed a refreshing plunge in the lake, and generally
ended up with supper in the cabin. When
he had time, which wasn&#8217;t often, Mr. Curtis
joined them. Usually Ranny Phelps was in
charge, and whenever they could they carried off
Mr. Grimstone for supper.</p>

<p>It was on one of these latter occasions, as they
sat out on the bank of the lake after supper, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
Frank Sanson suddenly voiced a feeling which
was present, more or less often, in the breast of
every scout in the troop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grimstone,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose you realize what a dandy thing you did
when you gave us this place. I don&#8217;t know what
we&#8217;d do without it now; do you, fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an emphatic chorus of agreement
which brought a touch of color into the old man&#8217;s
leathery, tanned face and made him shuffle his
feet uneasily. Then suddenly he raised his eyes
and there was a twinkle in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t me you ought to thank,&#8221; he said
abruptly. &#8220;It&#8217;s that Dale boy there; he&#8217;s to
blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dale Tompkins!&#8221; exclaimed several surprised
voices at once. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s he got to do with
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most everything,&#8221; returned Grimstone,
briefly. &#8220;It was him that brought out my dinner
last Thanksgivin&#8217;, an cooked it, an&#8217; et it with me.
That&#8217;s what give me a new idea of you boys, an&#8217;
nothin&#8217; else.&#8221;</p>

<p>An astonished silence followed, broken presently
by a low whistle from Mr. Curtis. &#8220;Well,
what do you know about that,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;A
good turn come home to roost!&#8221;</p>

<p>But no one heard him, for the whole crowd, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
one boy, had pounced on Tompkins and was pummeling
him and rolling him about over the
ground to the accompaniment of shouts and
laughter and jocular, approving comment.</p>

<p>Glancing sidewise at Caleb Grimstone, the
scoutmaster&#8217;s eyes widened with surprise and
sudden comprehension. The old man&#8217;s gaze was
fixed on the flushed, laughing face of the kicking,
protesting victim. His own brown face glowed;
his stern, tight lips were relaxed in a smile which
was almost tender.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SILVER CROSS</span></h2>

<p>In spite of their long and careful preparation,
the members of Troop Five were not a little
keyed up and excited when the night of the big
scout rally finally arrived. Each boy dressed
with unusual care, and the majority reached the
parish-house some time before the hour named
for assembling. From here they marched in good
order to the old-fashioned frame building, whose
entire third floor constituted the masonic hall,
where the performance was to come off. Another
troop was close on their heels, and, in their hurry
to get there first, the boys pushed and jostled one
another on the narrow, twisting stairs. But in
the hallway above they paused to fall in, and at
the word of command from Mr. Curtis they
marched through the double doors into the
brightly lighted assembly-room, wheeled smartly
to the right, and took up their position at one side
of the doorway.</p>

<p>The hall was already well filled and resounded
with the buzz of conversation. Pretty girls in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
Red Cross costumes flitted among the audience
seeking contributions and memberships. By
eight o&#8217;clock the rows of chairs that packed over
half the big room were occupied, and there were
people standing. When the doors were finally
closed and the entertainment began, the place was
almost uncomfortably jammed by a throng of
proud mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters
of the performers, to say nothing of a great
many other members of the community who were
interested in the movement or curious to see the
result of the past year&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>The first thing on the program was a review
and inspection of the entire scout body by Captain
Chalmers, who had unexpectedly obtained
leave of absence for the occasion. When this was
over, there followed a brief pause, during which
the captain, standing before the long, double row
of boyish figures, in their trim, immaculate uniforms,
conferred in whispers with Scoutmaster
Curtis, whom he had summoned from the line.
Instantly a faint, scarcely perceptible stir swept
down the lines of waiting scouts. What was coming?
they asked themselves eagerly. Dale Tompkins
caught the captain&#8217;s glance fixed on him for
a moment, and wondered uneasily whether anything
was the matter with his equipment. He
had no time to grow seriously disturbed, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
before Mr. Curtis returned to the head of the
troop and the captain faced the audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you have all heard more or less
about our scout law and the high principles it
inculcates in every boy who promises to obey it,&#8221;
he said in his pleasant, easy manner. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to tell you briefly about the way two scouts right
here in our own town applied some of the most
vital of these principles. The first incident happened
late last fall, when a powerfully charged
electric wire was blown down in a storm and
dangled in the street. A small boy saw it, and,
without realizing the danger, grasped it in both
hands. Instantly the current, passing into his
body, made him helpless. He screamed with pain
and struggled to tear himself loose, but in the
throng that quickly gathered no one dared to
touch him. No one, that is, until one of the
scouts I speak of appeared. He had been a tenderfoot
only a few days, but he was a true scout
at heart. Without hesitation he gripped the child
by one shoulder and was instantly flung the width
of the street. Recovering, he remembered something
he had read about electricity and insulation,
remembered that paper was a good non-conductor
and rubber even better. In a flash he had
wrapped about his hands some of the newspapers
he carried, flung down his waterproof delivery-bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
to stand on, and went again to the aid of the
child, this time successfully. It was not only a
brave deed, but he kept his head; and when the
danger was over he slipped quietly away without
waiting for either praise or thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of applause and hand-clapping came
from the audience, and while waiting for it to
subside the captain glanced again toward Dale
Tompkins. This time he did not meet the boy&#8217;s
questioning glance, but saw only drooping lids
and a face flushed crimson. His smile deepened
a little as he raised one hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few months later the other scout was skating
with a companion on Crystal Lake. He could
swim only a few strokes, but when the second
boy broke through the ice he did not hesitate an
instant in going to his rescue. He was dragged
into the water and nearly drowned, but he, too,
kept his head and held up his friend until help
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to think that the actions of those two
boys was typical rather than exceptional. I don&#8217;t
believe there is a scout here,&#8221; his glance swept
the line of khaki-clad figures for an instant, &#8220;who,
given the chance to risk his life for another, would
not respond exactly as these boys did. When I
heard of what they had done I applied to our national
council for honor medals such as are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
awarded to scouts for the saving of life. They
arrived some time ago, but I awaited this occasion
to present them. Scouts Dale Tompkins and
Frank Sanson will please step forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid the thunder of applause that followed,
Captain Chalmers turned and faced the line of
scouts again, two small square boxes in his hand.
Dazed, bewildered, and blushing furiously, Dale
stood as if rooted to the spot until Harry Vedder
gave him a sharp dig in the ribs. Then he stumbled
forward a few steps, realized that another
halting figure was beside him, and, recovering a
little, but with face still flushing, he crossed the
interminable space to where the captain stood.</p>

<p>One thing only was he thankful for at that moment&#8211;the
heartening touch of Sanson&#8217;s shoulder
against his own. To have faced the ordeal alone
would have been almost intolerable. He did not
raise his eyes above the third button on the captain&#8217;s
coat, and so he missed the look of pride and
approval the man bent on him as he pinned the silver
cross upon the boy&#8217;s left breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great pleasure for me to give you this,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and to thank you in the name of the
national council for having proved so great a
credit to the scouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale&#8217;s hand went up, and he saluted. &#8220;Thank
you, sir,&#8221; he said in a low tone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>&#8220;And remember, both of you,&#8221; went on the captain,
when he had placed the second cross on Sanson&#8217;s
coat, &#8220;that it isn&#8217;t the medal that counts,
but the deed which has earned it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boys turned and marched back to their
places the applause burst out again with renewed
vigor until it seemed as if it would never cease.
But at length it died away and the entertainment
proceeded. Troop Three started off with an exhibition
of signaling which was swift, snappy, and
on the minute. Then came some tent-erecting,
and, following that, two troops combined to give
an elaborate and graphic exhibition of their expertness
in first aid, which met with much favor.
When this was over, the troops who had finished
lined up and stood at ease on either side of the
center to give Troop Five room for their evolutions.</p>

<p>Bob Gibson&#8217;s position was directly in front of
the closed double doors leading into the hall. He
had scarcely taken it before he became conscious
of a distinct odor of something burning. For a
moment he was uneasy; then he remembered that
there was a register just behind him, and decided
that the janitor had probably chosen this
auspicious moment to consume in the furnace the
rubbishy accumulation of several offices on the
lower floors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>When the applause that greeted their appearance
had subsided, Mr. Curtis stepped forward to
explain briefly the purpose of their drill. He had
scarcely spoken more than a sentence or two when
Gibson became aware of a slight stir among some
of the audience and noticed that a number of those
in the front row seemed to be staring fixedly at
his feet.</p>

<p>A flush mounted to Bob&#8217;s forehead. He was
quite sure his shoes were immaculately polished.
He also realized perfectly that he ought not notice
the audience, but remain rigidly at attention.
But presently curiosity got the better of discipline.
He shot a furtive glance at his feet&#8211;a
glance that flashed sidewise beyond the trim shoes
and well-fitting leggings to rest in dumb, horrified
amazement on the crack extending below the
double doors, through which a thin line of smoke
was slowly trickling.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span><a id='link_31'></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RIOT WEDGE</span></h2>

<p>For a long moment Bob Gibson stood like one
petrified. He thought of the crowd, of the
narrow, twisted stairs, of panic. What ought he
do? What was there possible for him to do?
He tried to remember what the scout book
said about fires and panics, but his brain seemed
numb. Before it had cleared there came a choking
cry from the other side, and Bennie Rhead, the
youngest scout in the troop, slipped out of the line,
and before any one could stop him, had jerked
open the door to let in a rolling cloud of dense
black smoke.</p>

<p>Like a flash Wesley Becker leaped after him,
dragged him back, and slammed the door; but the
damage was done. There was a long, gasping,
concerted sigh, as of hundreds of people catching
their breath in unison; in a second more the hall
resounded with that cry which chills the blood
and sends shivers chasing down the spine. To
Gibson, standing pale and frightened, it seemed
as if that whole close-packed assemblage surged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
up like some awful monster and rushed toward
him, a bedlam of shrill sound; while out of doors
the wild clamor of the fire-alarm suddenly burst
forth to add horror to the scene.</p>

<p>Shaking and terrified, Bob nevertheless stood
motionless, partly because he did not know what
else to do, but mainly because the fellows on either
side of him had not stirred. He dug his teeth
into his under lip to keep back a frightened whimper,
and then of a sudden the clear, high voice of
Mr. Curtis rang out above the deafening din and
turmoil:</p>

<p>&#8220;Troop Five prepare to form double riot
wedge! One!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instinctively Bob leaped two paces forward and
a little to the right. In like fashion the others
darted to their positions with the swift precision
of machines. Not a scout failed. Even Bennie
Rhead, frightened as he was, made no mistake,
and in a trice the wedge was complete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two!&#8221; shouted the scoutmaster.</p>

<p>Down swung the staves, interlocking in a
double barrier of stout hickory backed by equally
sturdy muscle. The scoutmaster had barely time
to place himself at the apex of the wedge before
the mob struck it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold fast, boys!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Brace your feet
and don&#8217;t let them break the line!&#8221; He flung up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
both arms in the faces of the maddened throng.
&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;You can&#8217;t get out this
way. The stairs are impassable. Stop crowding!
There&#8217;s no danger if you keep your heads.
The fire-escapes are in good order. The windows&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest was choked off by the crushing weight
of the mob dashing against the barrier. Even in
the second row Bob felt the double line shake and
give under the strain, and instinctively he dropped
a shoulder against the pressure and spread out
his legs to brace himself. MacIlvaine noticed
what he was doing, and shouted to the others to
follow Bob&#8217;s example; and presently the line
steadied and held. Then a shrill whistle cut
through the clamor, stilling it a little and making
it possible to hear the stentorian voice of Captain
Chalmers from somewhere in the rear of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get out by the stairs! There are
fire-escapes at both front and rear. Ladders will
soon be raised to the other windows. There&#8217;s
no danger if you only keep your heads. Stop
crowding and form in line at the windows.
Scouts will see that these lines are kept and that
the women and children are taken out first.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i8'></a><img src='images/illus8.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Hold fast, boys!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Brace your feet and don&#8217;t let them break the line!&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>An inarticulate murmur followed his words, but
the wild din of a moment before was not resumed.
In a moment, too, the pressure of bodies against
the double line of scouts about the door began to
relax as those in the rear made haste to seek other
ways of escape. Presently it had ceased entirely,
and as the boys straightened up from their
cramped positions Mr. Curtis turned to face them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, fellows,&#8221; he said in a low,
quick tone. &#8220;That was corking! Steady, now,
for a minute or two longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>That minute or two seemed the longest space
of time Bob Gibson had ever known. Now that
the stress and strain of strenuous action was removed
he had time to think, to wonder&#8211;to be
afraid. His mother and father were both here;
so was Ted and little Flossie. Had they been in
that awful crush? he wondered, as his anxious
gaze flashed from one to another of the scurrying
groups. Had they been hurt? The smoke
was pouring more thickly into the hall, stinging
his eyes and catching his throat in a choking sort
of grip. Through the open windows came the
clash and clang of engines, the muffled roar of
excited crowds gathering below. Bob could see
nothing of his mother or the children, and a dry
sob came from his tight lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tention!&#8221; called the scoutmaster, sharply.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the two windows at this side of the
front, fellows. Line up on either side of them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
and keep the crowd in order. Women and children
first, remember. Left face! March!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob pivoted mechanically and moved forward
in step with MacIlvaine. Through the swirling
smoke he could see that the other troops had
gathered at different windows and were keeping
the crowd in line, helping the women and small
children through to the fire-escapes or out to the
ladders which had just been raised. By this time
the men, for the most part, had recovered from
their panic and were helping in the work. Suddenly
the boy caught sight of his mother in the
line of people close by the next window. She was
carrying Flossie, and his father had Ted over
one shoulder. They both looked so calm and
brave that Bob&#8217;s spine stiffened, and when he
caught his mother&#8217;s eye a moment later he was
able to smile and wave his hand almost as carelessly
as if his heart wasn&#8217;t pounding unevenly
at the sudden realization that not a scout could
stir until every one else was out of the building.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t a conscious longing for any one else&#8217;s
place. It was blind fear, pure and simple; and
though he tried to crush it down by thinking of
the people he was helping, it persisted and grew
stronger, just as the smoke grew steadily denser
and more choking, and the crackle of flames
seemed to come from behind the closed doors with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
ominous distinctness. When the electric lights
suddenly went out leaving only the two oil side-lamps
burning dimly, it was all he could do to
keep from crying out with terror. Indeed, he instinctively
took a quick step out of line toward
the window, but Mr. Curtis&#8217;s cool voice halted
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, Bob. Not quite yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s fingers dug into his palms and he
stepped quickly back into his place, a flush of
shame mantling his cheeks. Had any of the other
fellows noticed? he wondered. His questioning
glance swept along the line and was suddenly arrested
by the face of Dale Tompkins, who stood
a little beyond.</p>

<p>Dale was not looking at him; on the contrary,
he was staring back into the murky gloom of the
big room with an expression of such desperate
anxiety and fear that Gibson&#8217;s heart leaped, and
instinctively he turned his head to see what new
peril threatened. When he glanced back, after a
scrutiny that revealed nothing unexpected, Tompkins
had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221; gasped the boy, his surprise
mingled with a touch of envy. &#8220;He&#8217;s cut out and
got away!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dale had not run away. At that very moment,
instead of flying panic-stricken to a window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
as Bob supposed, he was groping his way through
the darkness toward the farther end of the smoke-filled
hall. As he passed behind the line of scouts
and pushed on through the thinning throng of
frightened people, fear filled his soul and brought
a tortured look into his smarting eyes&#8211;that fear
for another which is often so much more gripping
than the fear for self.</p>

<p>Ages ago, it seemed to the anxious boy, Ranny
Phelps had disappeared in this same direction and
had not returned. Dale had caught a disjointed
word or two about water-buckets, but where they
were or to what use Ranny meant to put them
he did not know. With growing alarm he had
watched and waited, and then, unable to stand
the suspense another instant, he slipped out of the
line and went to seek his friend.</p>

<p>As he passed the double doors the smoke
seemed to thicken, causing him to choke and sputter.
Where was it coming from, he wondered
dazedly. It was as if great volumes were pouring
freely into the hall, yet the doors to the corridor
had been closed from the first.</p>

<p>He stumbled over a chair and nearly fell. Recovering,
his outstretched hands struck the wall,
and he began to feel his way along it. Presently
his fingers gripped the edge of a door-casing, and
he staggered back as a fresh burst of suffocating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
fumes caught his lungs with a smothering clutch.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood there reeling. Then
in a flash he remembered the coat-room, remembered
the narrow pair of stairs leading down
from one corner with a row of red fire-buckets
on a bench beside it. These were the buckets
Ranny had come for. The door to the stairs was&#8211;open!</p>

<p>He caught his breath with a dry sob and plunged
into the pitchy darkness of the smaller room.
Two steps he took&#8211;three. Then his foot struck
against something, and he fell forward over a
body stretched out on the floor, his out-thrust arms
reaching beyond it.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought it was all over. His
senses were swimming in the clouds of deadly
smoke pouring up from below, and it took an appreciable
second or two to realize that the thing
one hand clutched instinctively was the edge of
an open door. Almost as instinctively he summoned
all his strength and flung it to. The resulting
slam came as something indistinct and far
away. He wondered if he were losing consciousness,
and in the same breath his jaw squared with
the stubborn determination that he would not&#8211;he
must not! As he reached up to tear the wide
handkerchief from about his neck his fingers
brushed the silver cross pinned to his left breast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
and the touch seemed to give him fresh courage.</p>

<p>With feverish haste he felt for Ranny&#8217;s wrists,
knotted the neckerchief about them, and, drawing
them over his head, began to crawl toward the
door. Too late he remembered the water in the
buckets and wished he had thought to dip a handkerchief
in that to breathe through. Doubtless it
was that very idea which had brought Ranny himself
here. But he did not dare turn back, and
after all, now that the stair door was closed, the
smoke did not seem quite so dense, especially
down here on the floor.</p>

<p>He reached the door and crawled through, dragging
his helpless burden with him. Through the
smoke the farther windows were vaguely outlined
against a flickering, reddish background. A
brighter line of fire marked the crack beneath
the double doors. Under his body, too, the floor
felt hot, and he could sense a queer, uneven pulsation
as if the boards were moving. What if the
flames should burst through before they could get
away? What if&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dale! Ranny! Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the scoutmaster&#8217;s voice, and Dale&#8217;s broke
a little as he answered. In another moment Mr.
Curtis was beside him, bending to lift the unconscious
boy in his arms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; he asked tersely as he
turned toward the windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scrambling to his feet, Dale stumbled after him.
A crackling roar from behind the closed doors
made him shiver. The windows were clear.
Every one seemed to have left the hall save a
single figure standing beside the nearest opening,
one leg already over the sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, Wes!&#8221; snapped Mr. Curtis. &#8220;Get out
on the ladder and take him. Fireman&#8217;s lift, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Becker obeyed swiftly, and, swinging the limp
body over his shoulder, disappeared from view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dale,&#8221; ordered the scoutmaster.
&#8220;You&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were drowned in a crashing roar as
the doors fell in. There was a sudden, blinding
burst of flame, a wave of scorching heat that
seemed to sear into Dale&#8217;s very soul. He flung up
both hands before his eyes, and, as he did so, two
arms grasped him about the body and fairly
whirled him through the window to the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch hold and slide!&#8221; commanded the scoutmaster.
&#8220;Hustle!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mechanically, as he had done a score of times
in their fire-drills from the roof of Mr. Curtis&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span>
barn, Dale curled arms and legs about the ladder
sides, shut his eyes, and slid. Part way down a
blast of heat struck his face; then hands caught
him, easing the descent, and he found himself on
the ground, with firemen all around and the cool
spray from one of the big, brass-nozzled hoses
drifting across him. He had scarcely time to step
away from the ladder when Mr. Curtis, with hair
singed and clothes smoking, shot out of the flame-tinged
smoke and came down with a rush, while
from the anxious crowd there burst a loud cheer
of relief and laxing tension.</p>

<p>Dale blinked and drew the clean air into his
lungs with long, uneven breaths. Then the grimy
face of Court Parker popped up suddenly before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Wes, and&#8211;and Ranny?&#8221; demanded
Tompkins sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dale pushed his way across the street and up
to the edge of a circle that some of the scouts
had formed about a small group on the farther
sidewalk. This opened to let him through, and
as he stood looking down on the handsome, blackened,
pallid face of the boy Becker and MacIlvaine
were working over, something seemed to grip his
throat and squeeze it tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he&#8211;&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;will he&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>Becker glanced up and nodded reassuringly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s coming round all right. He&#8217;s pretty well
done up, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the shadowy tangle of disordered hair
Ranny&#8217;s lids suddenly lifted, and the blue eyes
looked straight up into Dale&#8217;s face. For a second
there was absolutely no expression in them. Then
something flickered into the glance that made
Dale&#8217;s heart leap and sent the blood tingling to
the roots of his hair. A moment later the pale
lips moved, and he bent swiftly to catch the
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew&#8211;you&#8217;d come&#8211;chum,&#8221; Ranny whispered.
Then his lips curved in a rueful smile.
&#8220;Of all the rotten luck!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;They
never saw&#8211;our drill.&#8221;</p>
